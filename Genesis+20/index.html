While residing in Gerar as an alien,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-2">Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” And King Abimelech of Gerar sent and took Sarah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a married woman.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-4">Now Abimelech had not approached her; so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent people?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-5">Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-6">Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; furthermore it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-7">Now then, return the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-8">So Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-9">Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that ought not to be done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-10">And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-11">Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-12">Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-13">And when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-14">Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-15">Abimelech said, “My land is before you; settle where it pleases you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-16">To Sarah he said, “Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your exoneration before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-17">Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-20-18">For the Lord had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+19"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+21"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
