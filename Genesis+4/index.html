Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-3">In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-4">and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-5">but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-6">The Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-7">If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-8">Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-9">Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-10">And the Lord said, “What have you done? Listen; your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-11">And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-12">When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-13">Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-14">Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-15">Then the Lord said to him, “Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance.” And the Lord put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-16">Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-17">Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-18">To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-19">Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-20">Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-21">His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-22">Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-23">Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-24">If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-25">Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, “God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-26">To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+5"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
