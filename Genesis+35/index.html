Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-2">So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-3">then come, let us go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-4">So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-5">As they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities all around them, so that no one pursued them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-6">Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-7">and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-8">And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So it was called Allon-bacuth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-9">God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-10">God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall you be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” So he was called Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-11">God said to him, “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-12">The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-13">Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-14">Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-15">So Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-16">Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-17">When she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-18">As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-19">So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-20">and Jacob set up a pillar at her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s tomb, which is there to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-21">Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-22">While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-23">The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-24">The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-25">The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-26">The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-27">Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had resided as aliens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-28">Now the days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-29">And Isaac breathed his last; he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+34"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+36"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
