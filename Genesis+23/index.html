Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold from you any burial ground for burying your dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-7">Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-8">He said to them, “If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron son of Zohar,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-9">so that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as a possession for a burying place.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-10">Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-11">“No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it; in the presence of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-12">Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-13">He said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “If you only will listen to me! I will give the price of the field; accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-14">Ephron answered Abraham,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-15">“My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-16">Abraham agreed with Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-17">So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, passed&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-18">to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, in the presence of all who went in at the gate of his city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-19">After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-23-20">The field and the cave that is in it passed from the Hittites into Abraham’s possession as a burying place.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+22"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+24"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
