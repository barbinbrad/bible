He said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-2">He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-3">So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-4">On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-5">Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-6">Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-7">Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-8">Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-9">When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-10">Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-11">But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-12">He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-13">And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-14">So Abraham called that place “The Lord will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-15">The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-16">and said, “By myself I have sworn, says the Lord: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-17">I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-18">and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-19">So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-20">Now after these things it was told Abraham, “Milcah also has borne children, to your brother Nahor:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-21">Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-22">Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-23">Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-22-24">Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+21"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+23"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
