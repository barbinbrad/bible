They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-4">so that all the artisans who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task being performed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-5">and said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for doing the work that the Lord has commanded us to do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-6">So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-7">for what they had already brought was more than enough to do all the work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-8">All those with skill among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains; they were made of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked into them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-9">The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains were of the same size.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-10">He joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-11">He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-12">he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-13">And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains one to the other with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-14">He also made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-15">The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were of the same size.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-16">He joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-17">He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-18">He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it might be one whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-19">And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams’ skins and an outer covering of fine leather.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-20">Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-21">Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the width of each frame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-22">Each frame had two pegs for fitting together; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-23">The frames for the tabernacle he made in this way: twenty frames for the south side;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-24">and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under the first frame for its two pegs, and two bases under the next frame for its two pegs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-25">For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-26">and their forty bases of silver, two bases under the first frame and two bases under the next frame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-27">For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-28">He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-29">They were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; he made two of them in this way, for the two corners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-30">There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-31">He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-32">and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-33">He made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the frames.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-34">And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made rings of gold for them to hold the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-35">He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-36">For it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-37">He also made a screen for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-36-38">and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their bases with gold, but their five bases were of bronze.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+37/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
