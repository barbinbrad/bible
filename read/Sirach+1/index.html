Now, those who read the scriptures must not only themselves understand them, but must also as lovers of learning be able through the spoken and written word to help the outsiders. So my grandfather Jesus, who had devoted himself especially to the reading of the Law and the Prophets and the other books of our ancestors, and had acquired considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, so that by becoming familiar also with his book those who love learning might make even greater progress in living according to the law. You are invited therefore to read it with goodwill and attention, and to be indulgent in cases where, despite our diligent labor in translating, we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For what was originally expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same sense when translated into another language. Not only this book, but even the Law itself, the Prophecies, and the rest of the books differ not a little when read in the original. When I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes and stayed for some time, I found opportunity for no little instruction. It seemed highly necessary that I should myself devote some diligence and labor to the translation of this book. During that time I have applied my skill day and night to complete and publish the book for those living abroad who wished to gain learning and are disposed to live according to the law. All wisdom is from the Lord, and with him it remains forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-2">The sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity—who can count them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-3">The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth, the abyss, and wisdom—who can search them out?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-4">Wisdom was created before all other things, and prudent understanding from eternity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-5">The root of wisdom—to whom has it been revealed? Her subtleties—who knows them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-6">There is but one who is wise, greatly to be feared, seated upon his throne—the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-7">It is he who created her; he saw her and took her measure; he poured her out upon all his works,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-8">upon all the living according to his gift; he lavished her upon those who love him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-9">The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, and gladness and a crown of rejoicing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-10">The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives gladness and joy and long life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-11">Those who fear the Lord will have a happy end; on the day of their death they will be blessed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-12">To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; she is created with the faithful in the womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-13">She made among human beings an eternal foundation, and among their descendants she will abide faithfully.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-14">To fear the Lord is fullness of wisdom; she inebriates mortals with her fruits;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-15">she fills their whole house with desirable goods, and their storehouses with her produce.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-16">The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-17">She rained down knowledge and discerning comprehension, and she heightened the glory of those who held her fast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-18">To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom, and her branches are long life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-19">Unjust anger cannot be justified, for anger tips the scale to one’s ruin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-20">Those who are patient stay calm until the right moment, and then cheerfulness comes back to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-21">They hold back their words until the right moment; then the lips of many tell of their good sense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-22">In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings, but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-23">If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord will lavish her upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-24">For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline, fidelity and humility are his delight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-25">Do not disobey the fear of the Lord; do not approach him with a divided mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-26">Do not be a hypocrite before others, and keep watch over your lips.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-1-27">Do not exalt yourself, or you may fall and bring dishonor upon yourself. The Lord will reveal your secrets and overthrow you before the whole congregation, because you did not come in the fear of the Lord, and your heart was full of deceit.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
