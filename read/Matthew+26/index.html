She has performed a good service for me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-11">For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-12">By pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-13">Truly I tell you, wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-15">and said, “What will you give me if I betray him to you?” They paid him thirty pieces of silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-16">And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-17">On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-18">He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-20">When it was evening, he took his place with the twelve;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-21">and while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-22">And they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-23">He answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-24">The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-25">Judas, who betrayed him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” He replied, “You have said so.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-26">While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-27">Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-28">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-29">I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-30">When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-31">Then Jesus said to them, “You will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-32">But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-33">Peter said to him, “Though all become deserters because of you, I will never desert you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-34">Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-35">Peter said to him, “Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-36">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-37">He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and agitated.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-38">Then he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-39">And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-40">Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me one hour?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-41">Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-42">Again he went away for the second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-43">Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-44">So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-46">Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-47">While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-48">Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-49">At once he came up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-50">Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-51">Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-52">Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-53">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-54">But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-55">At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-56">But all this has taken place, so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-57">Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-58">But Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and going inside, he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-59">Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-60">but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-61">and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-62">The high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-63">But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-64">Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you, From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-66">What is your verdict?” They answered, “He deserves death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-67">Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-68">saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant-girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-70">But he denied it before all of them, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-71">When he went out to the porch, another servant-girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-72">Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-73">After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-74">Then he began to curse, and he swore an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment the cock crowed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-75">Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
