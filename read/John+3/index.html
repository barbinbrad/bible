Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-5">Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-6">What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-7">Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-8">The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-9">Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-10">Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-11">“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-12">If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-13">No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-14">And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-15">that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-16">“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-17">“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-18">Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-19">And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-20">For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-21">But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-22">After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he spent some time there with them and baptized.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-23">John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was abundant there; and people kept coming and were being baptized&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-24">—John, of course, had not yet been thrown into prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-25">Now a discussion about purification arose between John’s disciples and a Jew.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-26">They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing, and all are going to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-27">John answered, “No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-28">You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. For this reason my joy has been fulfilled.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-30">He must increase, but I must decrease.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-31">The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is above all.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-32">He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-33">Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this, that God is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-34">He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-35">The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-36">Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but must endure God’s wrath.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
