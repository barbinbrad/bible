for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-8">The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-12">If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-13">And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven,  the Son of man, who is in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-15">that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-17">For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-18">He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-19">And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-21">But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-24">For John was not yet cast into prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-25">There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-26">And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-30">He must increase, but I must decrease.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-32">What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-33">He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to , that God is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-3-36">He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
