they gave themselves first to the Lord and, by the will of God, to us,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-6">so that we might urge Titus that, as he had already made a beginning, so he should also complete this generous undertaking among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-7">Now as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in utmost eagerness, and in our love for you—so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-8">I do not say this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-9">For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-10">And in this matter I am giving my advice: it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something—&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-11">now finish doing it, so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-12">For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has—not according to what one does not have.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-13">I do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you, but it is a question of a fair balance between&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-14">your present abundance and their need, so that their abundance may be for your need, in order that there may be a fair balance.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-15">As it is written, “The one who had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too little.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-16">But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same eagerness for you that I myself have.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-17">For he not only accepted our appeal, but since he is more eager than ever, he is going to you of his own accord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-18">With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his proclaiming the good news;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-19">and not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this generous undertaking for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our goodwill.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-20">We intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-21">for we intend to do what is right not only in the Lord’s sight but also in the sight of others.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-22">And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found eager in many matters, but who is now more eager than ever because of his great confidence in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-23">As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker in your service; as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-24">Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Corinthians+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
