now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable  toward the four winds of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious .&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-12">And the host was given over  together with the continual  through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did  and prospered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision  the continual , and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-14">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings  mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-16">And I heard a man’s voice between  the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-20">The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-22">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-25">And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in  security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days .&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-27">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Daniel+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Daniel+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
