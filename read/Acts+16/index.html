We remained in this city for some days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-13">On the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-14">A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-15">When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home.” And she prevailed upon us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-16">One day, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-17">While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, “These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-18">She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-19">But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-20">When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, “These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-21">and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-22">The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-23">After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-24">Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-25">About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-26">Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-27">When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-28">But Paul shouted in a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-29">The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-30">Then he brought them outside and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-31">They answered, “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-32">They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-33">At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-34">He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-35">When morning came, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-36">And the jailer reported the message to Paul, saying, “The magistrates sent word to let you go; therefore come out now and go in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-37">But Paul replied, “They have beaten us in public, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they going to discharge us in secret? Certainly not! Let them come and take us out themselves.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-38">The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-39">so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-40">After leaving the prison they went to Lydia’s home; and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there, they departed.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
