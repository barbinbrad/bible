Now it was the sabbath on that day. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-9">So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-10">But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-11">They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up , and walk?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-12">But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-13">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-14">The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-15">And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-16">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-17">For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-18">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-19">For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-20">For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-21">For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-22">that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-23">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-25">For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-26">and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-27">Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-28">and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-29">I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-30">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-31">It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-32">Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-33">But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-34">He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-35">But the witness which I have is greater than  John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-36">And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-37">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-38">Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-39">and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-40">I receive not glory from men.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-41">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-42">I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-43">How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that  from the only God ye seek not?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-44">Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you,  Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-45">For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-46">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
