It is the passover of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-12">For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-13">The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-14">This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-15">Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day shall be cut off from Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-16">On the first day you shall hold a solemn assembly, and on the seventh day a solemn assembly; no work shall be done on those days; only what everyone must eat, that alone may be prepared by you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-17">You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your companies out of the land of Egypt: you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-18">In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day, you shall eat unleavened bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-19">For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether an alien or a native of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-20">You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat unleavened bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-21">Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-22">Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood in the basin. None of you shall go outside the door of your house until morning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-23">For the Lord will pass through to strike down the Egyptians; when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over that door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-24">You shall observe this rite as a perpetual ordinance for you and your children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-25">When you come to the land that the Lord will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this observance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-26">And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this observance?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-27">you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to the Lord, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he struck down the Egyptians but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed down and worshiped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-28">The Israelites went and did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-29">At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-30">Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his officials and all the Egyptians; and there was a loud cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-31">Then he summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, “Rise up, go away from my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord, as you said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-32">Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone. And bring a blessing on me too!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-33">The Egyptians urged the people to hasten their departure from the land, for they said, “We shall all be dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-34">So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-35">The Israelites had done as Moses told them; they had asked the Egyptians for jewelry of silver and gold, and for clothing,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-36">and the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And so they plundered the Egyptians.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-37">The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-38">A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers, both flocks and herds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-39">They baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt; it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-40">The time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-41">At the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the companies of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-42">That was for the Lord a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. That same night is a vigil to be kept for the Lord by all the Israelites throughout their generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-43">The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-44">but any slave who has been purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-45">no bound or hired servant may eat of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-46">It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the animal outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-47">The whole congregation of Israel shall celebrate it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-48">If an alien who resides with you wants to celebrate the passover to the Lord, all his males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to celebrate it; he shall be regarded as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-49">there shall be one law for the native and for the alien who resides among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-50">All the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-12-51">That very day the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, company by company.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
