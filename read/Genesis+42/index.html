And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-7">And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-8">And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-9">And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-10">And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-11">We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-12">And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-13">And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-14">And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-15">hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-16">Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-17">And he put them all together into ward three days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-18">And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-19">if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-20">and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-21">And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-22">And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-23">And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-24">And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-25">Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-26">And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-27">And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-28">And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-29">And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-30">The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-31">And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-32">we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-33">And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take  the famine of your houses, and go your way;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-34">and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-35">And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-36">And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-37">And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-42-38">And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+41/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+43/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
