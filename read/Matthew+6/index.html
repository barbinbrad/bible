Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-3">But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-4">so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-5">“And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-6">But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-7">“When you are praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-9">“Pray then in this way: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-10">Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-11">Give us this day our daily bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-12">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-13">And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-14">For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-15">but if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-16">“And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-17">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-18">so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-19">“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-20">but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-22">“The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-23">but if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-24">“No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-25">“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-26">Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-27">And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-28">And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-29">yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-30">But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-31">Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-32">For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-33">But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-6-34">“So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
