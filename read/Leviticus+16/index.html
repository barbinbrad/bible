He shall bathe his body in water, and then put them on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-5">He shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-6">Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-7">He shall take the two goats and set them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-8">and Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-9">Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer it as a sin offering;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-10">but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-11">Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house; he shall slaughter the bull as a sin offering for himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-12">He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the Lord, and two handfuls of crushed sweet incense, and he shall bring it inside the curtain&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-13">and put the incense on the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the covenant, or he will die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-14">He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-15">He shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-16">Thus he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, and because of their transgressions, all their sins; and so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which remains with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-17">No one shall be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the sanctuary until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-18">Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord and make atonement on its behalf, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat, and put it on each of the horns of the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-19">He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-20">When he has finished atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-21">Then Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and sending it away into the wilderness by means of someone designated for the task.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-22">The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a barren region; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-23">Then Aaron shall enter the tent of meeting, and shall take off the linen vestments that he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-24">He shall bathe his body in water in a holy place, and put on his vestments; then he shall come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-25">The fat of the sin offering he shall turn into smoke on the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-26">The one who sets the goat free for Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward may come into the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-27">The bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp; their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be consumed in fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-28">The one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward may come into the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-29">This shall be a statute to you forever: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall deny yourselves, and shall do no work, neither the citizen nor the alien who resides among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-30">For on this day atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-31">It is a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall deny yourselves; it is a statute forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-32">The priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his fatherâ€™s place shall make atonement, wearing the linen vestments, the holy vestments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-33">He shall make atonement for the sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-16-34">This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the people of Israel once in the year for all their sins. And Moses did as the Lord had commanded him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
