And they said, Of Haran are we.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-5">And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-6">And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-7">And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-8">And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-9">While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-10">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-11">And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-12">And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-13">And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-14">And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-15">And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-16">And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-17">And Leah’s eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-18">And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-19">And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-20">And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-21">And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-22">And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-23">And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-24">And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-25">And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-26">And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-27">Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-28">And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-29">And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-30">And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-31">And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-32">And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-33">And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this  also: and she called his name Simeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-34">And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-35">And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I praise Jehovah: therefore she called his name Judah; and she left off bearing.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+30/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
