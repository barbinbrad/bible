The stone on the well’s mouth was large,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-3">and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-4">Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, “We are from Haran.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-5">He said to them, “Do you know Laban son of Nahor?” They said, “We do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-6">He said to them, “Is it well with him?” “Yes,” they replied, “and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with the sheep.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-7">He said, “Look, it is still broad daylight; it is not time for the animals to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-8">But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-9">While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-10">Now when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, and the sheep of his mother’s brother Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of his mother’s brother Laban.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-11">Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-12">And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-13">When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him; he embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-14">and Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-15">Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-16">Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-17">Leah’s eyes were lovely, and Rachel was graceful and beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-18">Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-19">Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-20">So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-21">Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-22">So Laban gathered together all the people of the place, and made a feast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-23">But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-24">(Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-25">When morning came, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-26">Laban said, “This is not done in our country—giving the younger before the firstborn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-27">Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-28">Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-29">(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-30">So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. He served Laban for another seven years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-31">When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-32">Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben; for she said, “Because the Lord has looked on my affliction; surely now my husband will love me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-33">She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the Lord has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also”; and she named him Simeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-34">Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons”; therefore he was named Levi.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-29-35">She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “This time I will praise the Lord”; therefore she named him Judah; then she ceased bearing.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+30/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
