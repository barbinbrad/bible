that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-11">being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-12">Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things  unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-13">so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-14">and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-16">the one  of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-17">but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-18">What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-19">For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but  with all boldness, as always,  now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-22">But if to live in the flesh,â€”this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-23">But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-24">yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-26">that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-27">Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-28">and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-29">because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-1-30">having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ephesians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Philippians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
