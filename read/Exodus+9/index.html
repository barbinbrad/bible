But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the people go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-8">Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw it in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-9">It shall become fine dust all over the land of Egypt, and shall cause festering boils on humans and animals throughout the whole land of Egypt.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-10">So they took soot from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw it in the air, and it caused festering boils on humans and animals.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-11">The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils afflicted the magicians as well as all the Egyptians.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-12">But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-13">Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-14">For this time I will send all my plagues upon you yourself, and upon your officials, and upon your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-15">For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-16">But this is why I have let you live: to show you my power, and to make my name resound through all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-17">You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-18">Tomorrow at this time I will cause the heaviest hail to fall that has ever fallen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-19">Send, therefore, and have your livestock and everything that you have in the open field brought to a secure place; every human or animal that is in the open field and is not brought under shelter will die when the hail comes down upon them.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-20">Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord hurried their slaves and livestock off to a secure place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-21">Those who did not regard the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock in the open field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-22">The Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that hail may fall on the whole land of Egypt, on humans and animals and all the plants of the field in the land of Egypt.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-23">Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire came down on the earth. And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-24">there was hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of it, such heavy hail as had never fallen in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-25">The hail struck down everything that was in the open field throughout all the land of Egypt, both human and animal; the hail also struck down all the plants of the field, and shattered every tree in the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-26">Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-27">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “This time I have sinned; the Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-28">Pray to the Lord! Enough of God’s thunder and hail! I will let you go; you need stay no longer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-29">Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the Lord’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-30">But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-31">(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-32">But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-33">So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and stretched out his hands to the Lord; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-34">But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned once more and hardened his heart, he and his officials.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-9-35">So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
