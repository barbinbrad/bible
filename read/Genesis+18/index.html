And they said, So do, as thou hast said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-9">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-11">Now Abraham and Sarah were old,  well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-12">And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-13">And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-14">Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-16">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-17">And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-18">seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-19">For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-20">And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-22">And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-24">Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-26">And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-28">peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-30">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-18-33">And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
