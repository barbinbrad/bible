A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-3">Under it were panels all around, each of ten cubits, surrounding the sea; there were two rows of panels, cast when it was cast.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-4">It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set on them. The hindquarters of each were toward the inside.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-5">Its thickness was a handbreadth; its rim was made like the rim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held three thousand baths.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-6">He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the right side, and five on the left. In these they were to rinse what was used for the burnt offering. The sea was for the priests to wash in.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-7">He made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-8">He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-9">He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court; he overlaid their doors with bronze.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-10">He set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-11">And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. Thus Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-12">the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-13">the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-14">He made the stands, the basins on the stands,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-15">the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-16">The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-17">In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-18">Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight of the bronze was not determined.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-19">So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-20">the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-21">the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-4-22">the snuffers, basins, ladles, and firepans, of pure gold.
