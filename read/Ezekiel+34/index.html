Should not shepherds feed the sheep?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-3">You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-4">You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-5">So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-6">My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-7">Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-8">As I live, says the Lord God, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-9">therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-10">Thus says the Lord God, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-11">For thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-12">As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-13">I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-14">I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-15">I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-16">I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-17">As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-18">Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? When you drink of clear water, must you foul the rest with your feet?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-19">And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-20">Therefore, thus says the Lord God to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-21">Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-22">I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-23">I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-24">And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the Lord, have spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-25">I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild animals from the land, so that they may live in the wild and sleep in the woods securely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-26">I will make them and the region around my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-27">The trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase. They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the hands of those who enslaved them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-28">They shall no more be plunder for the nations, nor shall the animals of the land devour them; they shall live in safety, and no one shall make them afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-29">I will provide for them a splendid vegetation so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the insults of the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-30">They shall know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-34-31">You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture and I am your God, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
