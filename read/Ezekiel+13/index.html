There will be a deluge of rain, great hailstones will fall, and a stormy wind will break out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-12">When the wall falls, will it not be said to you, “Where is the whitewash you smeared on it?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-13">Therefore thus says the Lord God: In my wrath I will make a stormy wind break out, and in my anger there shall be a deluge of rain, and hailstones in wrath to destroy it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-14">I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you shall perish within it; and you shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-15">Thus I will spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it—&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-16">the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for it, when there was no peace, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-17">As for you, mortal, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own imagination; prophesy against them&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-13-18">and say, Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the women who sew bands on all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every height, in the hunt for human lives!
