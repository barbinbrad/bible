If you pursue, you will not overtake, and by fleeing you will not escape.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-11">There are those who work and struggle and hurry, but are so much the more in want.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-12">There are others who are slow and need help, who lack strength and abound in poverty; but the eyes of the Lord look kindly upon them; he lifts them out of their lowly condition&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-13">and raises up their heads to the amazement of the many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-14">Good things and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, come from the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-15">The Lord’s gift remains with the devout, and his favor brings lasting success.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-16">One becomes rich through diligence and self-denial, and the reward allotted to him is this:&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-17">when he says, “I have found rest, and now I shall feast on my goods!” he does not know how long it will be until he leaves them to others and dies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-18">Stand by your agreement and attend to it, and grow old in your work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-19">Do not wonder at the works of a sinner, but trust in the Lord and keep at your job; for it is easy in the sight of the Lord to make the poor rich suddenly, in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-20">The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the pious, and quickly God causes his blessing to flourish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-21">Do not say, “What do I need, and what further benefit can be mine?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-22">Do not say, “I have enough, and what harm can come to me now?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-23">In the day of prosperity, adversity is forgotten, and in the day of adversity, prosperity is not remembered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-24">For it is easy for the Lord on the day of death to reward individuals according to their conduct.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-25">An hour’s misery makes one forget past delights, and at the close of one’s life one’s deeds are revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-26">Call no one happy before his death; by how he ends, a person becomes known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-27">Do not invite everyone into your home, for many are the tricks of the crafty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-28">Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the mind of the proud, and like spies they observe your weakness;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-29">for they lie in wait, turning good into evil, and to worthy actions they attach blame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-30">From a spark many coals are kindled, and a sinner lies in wait to shed blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-31">Beware of scoundrels, for they devise evil, and they may ruin your reputation forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-11-32">Receive strangers into your home and they will stir up trouble for you, and will make you a stranger to your own family.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
