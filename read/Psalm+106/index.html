O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-2">Who can utter the mighty doings of the Lord, or declare all his praise?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-3">Happy are those who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-4">Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people; help me when you deliver them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-5">that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory in your heritage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-6">Both we and our ancestors have sinned; we have committed iniquity, have done wickedly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-7">Our ancestors, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-8">Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, so that he might make known his mighty power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-9">He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; he led them through the deep as through a desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-10">So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-11">The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-12">Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-13">But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-14">But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-15">he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-16">They were jealous of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the faction of Abiram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-18">Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-19">They made a calf at Horeb and worshiped a cast image.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-20">They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-21">They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-22">wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-23">Therefore he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-24">Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-25">They grumbled in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-26">Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-27">and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-28">Then they attached themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-29">they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-30">Then Phinehas stood up and interceded, and the plague was stopped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-31">And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-32">They angered the Lord at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-33">for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-34">They did not destroy the peoples, as the Lord commanded them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-35">but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-36">They served their idols, which became a snare to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-37">They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-38">they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-39">Thus they became unclean by their acts, and prostituted themselves in their doings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-40">Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-41">he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-42">Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-43">Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-44">Nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-45">For their sake he remembered his covenant, and showed compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-46">He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-47">Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-48">Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. And let all the people say, “Amen.” Praise the Lord!&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+105/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+107/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
