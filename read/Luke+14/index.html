So Jesus took him and healed him, and sent him away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-5">Then he said to them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well, will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-6">And they could not reply to this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-7">When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-8">“When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-9">and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, ‘Give this person your place,’ and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-10">But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher’; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-11">For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-12">He said also to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-13">But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-14">And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-15">One of the dinner guests, on hearing this, said to him, “Blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-16">Then Jesus said to him, “Someone gave a great dinner and invited many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-17">At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come; for everything is ready now.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-18">But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-19">Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-20">Another said, ‘I have just been married, and therefore I cannot come.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-21">So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-22">And the slave said, ‘Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-23">Then the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-24">For I tell you, none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-25">Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-26">“Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-27">Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-28">For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-29">Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-30">saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-31">Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-32">If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-33">So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-34">“Salt is good; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-14-35">It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
