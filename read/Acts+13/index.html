The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-9">But Saul, who is also  Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-10">and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-11">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-13">Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-14">But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-16">And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken: &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-18">And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-19">And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave  their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-20">and after these things he gave  judges until Samuel the prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-21">And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-22">And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-23">Of this manâ€™s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-24">when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-25">And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not . But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-26">Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-27">For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled  by condemning .&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-28">And though they found no cause of death , yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-29">And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-30">But God raised him from the dead:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-31">and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-32">And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-33">that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-34">And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure  of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-35">Because he saith also in another , Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-36">For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-37">but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-38">Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-39">and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-40">Beware therefore, lest that come upon  which is spoken in the prophets:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-41">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-42">And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-43">Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-44">And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-46">And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-47">For so hath the Lord commanded us, , I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-48">And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-49">And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-50">But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-51">But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-13-52">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
