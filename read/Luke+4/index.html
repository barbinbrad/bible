He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-3">The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-4">Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘One does not live by bread alone.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-5">Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-6">And the devil said to him, “To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-7">If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-8">Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-9">Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-10">for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-11">and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-12">Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-13">When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-14">Then Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-15">He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-16">When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-17">and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-18">“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-19">to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-20">And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-21">Then he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-22">All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They said, “Is not this Joseph’s son?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-23">He said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘Doctor, cure yourself!’ And you will say, ‘Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-24">And he said, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet’s hometown.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-25">But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-26">yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-27">There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-28">When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-29">They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-30">But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-31">He went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-32">They were astounded at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-33">In the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-34">“Let us alone! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-35">But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” When the demon had thrown him down before them, he came out of him without having done him any harm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-36">They were all amazed and kept saying to one another, “What kind of utterance is this? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and out they come!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-37">And a report about him began to reach every place in the region.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-38">After leaving the synagogue he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked him about her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-39">Then he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-40">As the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-41">Demons also came out of many, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-42">At daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds were looking for him; and when they reached him, they wanted to prevent him from leaving them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-43">But he said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-44">So he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of Judea.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
