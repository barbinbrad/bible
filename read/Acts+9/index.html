The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” He answered, “Here I am, Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-11">The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-12">and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-13">But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-14">and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-15">But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-16">I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-17">So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-18">And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-19">and after taking some food, he regained his strength. For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-20">and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is the Son of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-21">All who heard him were amazed and said, “Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem among those who invoked this name? And has he not come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-22">Saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Messiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-23">After some time had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-24">but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-25">but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-26">When he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-27">But Barnabas took him, brought him to the apostles, and described for them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-28">So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-29">He spoke and argued with the Hellenists; but they were attempting to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-30">When the believers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-31">Meanwhile the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and was built up. Living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-32">Now as Peter went here and there among all the believers, he came down also to the saints living in Lydda.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-33">There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, for he was paralyzed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-34">Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed!” And immediately he got up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-35">And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-36">Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-37">At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-38">Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, “Please come to us without delay.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-39">So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-40">Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-41">He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-42">This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-9-43">Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
