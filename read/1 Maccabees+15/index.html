All the weapons that you have prepared and the strongholds that you have built and now hold shall remain yours.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-8">Every debt you owe to the royal treasury and any such future debts shall be canceled for you from henceforth and for all time.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-9">When we gain control of our kingdom, we will bestow great honor on you and your nation and the temple, so that your glory will become manifest in all the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-10">In the one hundred seventy-fourth year Antiochus set out and invaded the land of his ancestors. All the troops rallied to him, so that there were only a few with Trypho.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-11">Antiochus pursued him, and Trypho came in his flight to Dor, which is by the sea;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-12">for he knew that troubles had converged on him, and his troops had deserted him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-13">So Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him were one hundred twenty thousand warriors and eight thousand cavalry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-14">He surrounded the town, and the ships joined battle from the sea; he pressed the town hard from land and sea, and permitted no one to leave or enter it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-15">Then Numenius and his companions arrived from Rome, with letters to the kings and countries, in which the following was written:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-16">“Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greetings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-17">The envoys of the Jews have come to us as our friends and allies to renew our ancient friendship and alliance. They had been sent by the high priest Simon and by the Jewish people&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-18">and have brought a gold shield weighing one thousand minas.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-19">We therefore have decided to write to the kings and countries that they should not seek their harm or make war against them and their cities and their country, or make alliance with those who war against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-20">And it has seemed good to us to accept the shield from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-21">Therefore if any scoundrels have fled to you from their country, hand them over to the high priest Simon, so that he may punish them according to their law.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-22">The consul wrote the same thing to King Demetrius and to Attalus and Ariarathes and Arsaces,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-23">and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and to the Spartans, and to Delos, and to Myndos, and to Sicyon, and to Caria, and to Samos, and to Pamphylia, and to Lycia, and to Halicarnassus, and to Rhodes, and to Phaselis, and to Cos, and to Side, and to Aradus and Gortyna and Cnidus and Cyprus and Cyrene.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-24">They also sent a copy of these things to the high priest Simon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-25">King Antiochus besieged Dor for the second time, continually throwing his forces against it and making engines of war; and he shut Trypho up and kept him from going out or in.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-26">And Simon sent to Antiochus two thousand picked troops, to fight for him, and silver and gold and a large amount of military equipment.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-27">But he refused to receive them, and broke all the agreements he formerly had made with Simon, and became estranged from him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-28">He sent to him Athenobius, one of his Friends, to confer with him, saying, “You hold control of Joppa and Gazara and the citadel in Jerusalem; they are cities of my kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-29">You have devastated their territory, you have done great damage in the land, and you have taken possession of many places in my kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-30">Now then, hand over the cities that you have seized and the tribute money of the places that you have conquered outside the borders of Judea;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-31">or else pay me five hundred talents of silver for the destruction that you have caused and five hundred talents more for the tribute money of the cities. Otherwise we will come and make war on you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-32">So Athenobius, the king’s Friend, came to Jerusalem, and when he saw the splendor of Simon, and the sideboard with its gold and silver plate, and his great magnificence, he was amazed. When he reported to him the king’s message,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-33">Simon said to him in reply: “We have neither taken foreign land nor seized foreign property, but only the inheritance of our ancestors, which at one time had been unjustly taken by our enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-34">Now that we have the opportunity, we are firmly holding the inheritance of our ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-35">As for Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they were causing great damage among the people and to our land; for them we will give you one hundred talents.” Athenobius did not answer him a word, &nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-36">but returned in wrath to the king and reported to him these words, and also the splendor of Simon and all that he had seen. And the king was very angry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-37">Meanwhile Trypho embarked on a ship and escaped to Orthosia.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-38">Then the king made Cendebeus commander-in-chief of the coastal country, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-39">He commanded him to encamp against Judea, to build up Kedron and fortify its gates, and to make war on the people; but the king pursued Trypho.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-40">So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and invade Judea and take the people captive and kill them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-15-41">He built up Kedron and stationed horsemen and troops there, so that they might go out and make raids along the highways of Judea, as the king had ordered him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
