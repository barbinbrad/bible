They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-4">But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-5">Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-8">But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net  of fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-9">So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-10">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-11">Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-12">Jesus saith unto them, Come  break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-13">Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-14">This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-15">So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,  of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-16">He saith to him again a second time, Simon,  of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-17">He saith unto him the third time, Simon,  of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-18">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-19">Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-20">Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-21">Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-22">Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what  to thee? follow thou me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-23">This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what  to thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-24">This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-21-25">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
