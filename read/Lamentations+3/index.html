he hath broken my bones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-5">He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-6">He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-7">He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-8">Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-9">He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-10">He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-13">He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-14">I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-15">He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-16">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-17">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-18">And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-19">Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-20">My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-21">This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-22">Jehovahâ€™s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-23">They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-24">Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-25">Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-26">It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-28">Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-29">Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-30">Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-32">For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-33">For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-34">To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-37">Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-38">Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-42">We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-43">Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-45">Thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-46">All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-47">Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-48">Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-49">Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-50">Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-51">Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-52">They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-54">Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-55">I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-56">Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-57">Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee;

judge thou my cause.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-63">Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-64">Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-65">Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-3-66">Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Lamentations+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Lamentations+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
