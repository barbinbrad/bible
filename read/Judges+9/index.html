So they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-9">The olive tree answered them, ‘Shall I stop producing my rich oil by which gods and mortals are honored, and go to sway over the trees?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-10">Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-11">But the fig tree answered them, ‘Shall I stop producing my sweetness and my delicious fruit, and go to sway over the trees?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-12">Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-13">But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I stop producing my wine that cheers gods and mortals, and go to sway over the trees?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-14">So all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-15">And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-16">“Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and honor when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as his actions deserved—&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-17">for my father fought for you, and risked his life, and rescued you from the hand of Midian;&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-18">but you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your kinsman—&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-19">if, I say, you have acted in good faith and honor with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-20">but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the lords of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the lords of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-21">Then Jotham ran away and fled, going to Beer, where he remained for fear of his brother Abimelech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-22">Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-23">But God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem; and the lords of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-24">This happened so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged and their blood be laid on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the lords of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-25">So, out of hostility to him, the lords of Shechem set ambushes on the mountain tops. They robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was reported to Abimelech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-26">When Gaal son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his kinsfolk, the lords of Shechem put confidence in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-27">They went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and celebrated. Then they went into the temple of their god, ate and drank, and ridiculed Abimelech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-28">Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Did not the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-29">If only this people were under my command! Then I would remove Abimelech; I would say to him, ‘Increase your army, and come out.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-30">When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-31">He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah, saying, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his kinsfolk have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-32">Now therefore, go by night, you and the troops that are with you, and lie in wait in the fields.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-33">Then early in the morning, as soon as the sun rises, get up and rush on the city; and when he and the troops that are with him come out against you, you may deal with them as best you can.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-34">So Abimelech and all the troops with him got up by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-35">When Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, Abimelech and the troops with him rose from the ambush.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-36">And when Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountain tops!” And Zebul said to him, “The shadows on the mountains look like people to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-37">Gaal spoke again and said, “Look, people are coming down from Tabbur-erez, and one company is coming from the direction of Elon-meonenim.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-38">Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your boast now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the troops you made light of? Go out now and fight with them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-39">So Gaal went out at the head of the lords of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-40">Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. Many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-41">So Abimelech resided at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his kinsfolk, so that they could not live on at Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-42">On the following day the people went out into the fields. When Abimelech was told,&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-43">he took his troops and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the fields. When he looked and saw the people coming out of the city, he rose against them and killed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-44">Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed on all who were in the fields and killed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-45">Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city, and killed the people that were in it; and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-46">When all the lords of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the temple of El-berith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-47">Abimelech was told that all the lords of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-48">So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the troops that were with him. Abimelech took an ax in his hand, cut down a bundle of brushwood, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the troops with him, “What you have seen me do, do quickly, as I have done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-49">So every one of the troops cut down a bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-50">Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-51">But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the lords of the city fled to it and shut themselves in; and they went to the roof of the tower.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-52">Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-53">But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and crushed his skull.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-54">Immediately he called to the young man who carried his armor and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so people will not say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So the young man thrust him through, and he died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-55">When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-56">Thus God repaid Abimelech for the crime he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers;&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-9-57">and God also made all the wickedness of the people of Shechem fall back on their heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Judges+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judges+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
