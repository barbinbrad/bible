A faithful God, without deceit, just and upright is he;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-5">yet his degenerate children have dealt falsely with him, a perverse and crooked generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-6">Do you thus repay the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-7">Remember the days of old, consider the years long past; ask your father, and he will inform you; your elders, and they will tell you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-8">When the Most High apportioned the nations, when he divided humankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the gods;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-9">the Lord’s own portion was his people, Jacob his allotted share.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-10">He sustained him in a desert land, in a howling wilderness waste; he shielded him, cared for him, guarded him as the apple of his eye.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-11">As an eagle stirs up its nest, and hovers over its young; as it spreads its wings, takes them up, and bears them aloft on its pinions,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-12">the Lord alone guided him; no foreign god was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-13">He set him atop the heights of the land, and fed him with produce of the field; he nursed him with honey from the crags, with oil from flinty rock;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-14">curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs and rams; Bashan bulls and goats, together with the choicest wheat— you drank fine wine from the blood of grapes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-15">Jacob ate his fill; Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You grew fat, bloated, and gorged! He abandoned God who made him, and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-16">They made him jealous with strange gods, with abhorrent things they provoked him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-17">They sacrificed to demons, not God, to deities they had never known, to new ones recently arrived, whom your ancestors had not feared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-18">You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-19">The Lord saw it, and was jealous; he spurned his sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-20">He said: I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children in whom there is no faithfulness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-21">They made me jealous with what is no god, provoked me with their idols. So I will make them jealous with what is no people, provoke them with a foolish nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-22">For a fire is kindled by my anger, and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-23">I will heap disasters upon them, spend my arrows against them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-24">wasting hunger, burning consumption, bitter pestilence. The teeth of beasts I will send against them, with venom of things crawling in the dust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-25">In the street the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers terror, for young man and woman alike, nursing child and old gray head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-26">I thought to scatter them and blot out the memory of them from humankind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-27">but I feared provocation by the enemy, for their adversaries might misunderstand and say, “Our hand is triumphant; it was not the Lord who did all this.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-28">They are a nation void of sense; there is no understanding in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-29">If they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern what the end would be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-30">How could one have routed a thousand, and two put a myriad to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, the Lord had given them up?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-31">Indeed their rock is not like our Rock; our enemies are fools.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-32">Their vine comes from the vinestock of Sodom, from the vineyards of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-33">their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-34">Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-35">Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; because the day of their calamity is at hand, their doom comes swiftly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-36">Indeed the Lord will vindicate his people, have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, neither bond nor free remaining.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-37">Then he will say: Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-38">who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their libations? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection!&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-39">See now that I, even I, am he; there is no god besides me. I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and no one can deliver from my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-40">For I lift up my hand to heaven, and swear: As I live forever,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-41">when I whet my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-42">I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh— with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-43">Praise, O heavens, his people, worship him, all you gods! For he will avenge the blood of his children, and take vengeance on his adversaries; he will repay those who hate him, and cleanse the land for his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-44">Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua son of Nun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-45">When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-46">he said to them: “Take to heart all the words that I am giving in witness against you today; give them as a command to your children, so that they may diligently observe all the words of this law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-47">This is no trifling matter for you, but rather your very life; through it you may live long in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-48">On that very day the Lord addressed Moses as follows:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-49">“Ascend this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites for a possession;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-50">you shall die there on the mountain that you ascend and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-51">because both of you broke faith with me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, by failing to maintain my holiness among the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-32-52">Although you may view the land from a distance, you shall not enter it—the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
