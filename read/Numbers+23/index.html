Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-4">Then God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars, and have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-5">The Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you must say.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-6">So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-7">Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: “Balak has brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: ‘Come, curse Jacob for me; Come, denounce Israel!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-8">How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-9">For from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I behold him. Here is a people living alone, and not reckoning itself among the nations!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-10">Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the dust-cloud of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-11">Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but now you have done nothing but bless them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-12">He answered, “Must I not take care to say what the Lord puts into my mouth?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-13">So Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only part of them, and shall not see them all; then curse them for me from there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-14">So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah. He built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-15">Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offerings, while I meet the Lord over there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-16">The Lord met Balaam, put a word into his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you shall say.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-17">When he came to him, he was standing beside his burnt offerings with the officials of Moab. Balak said to him, “What has the Lord said?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-18">Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: “Rise, Balak, and hear; listen to me, O son of Zippor:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-19">God is not a human being, that he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change his mind. Has he promised, and will he not do it? Has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-20">See, I received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-21">He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob; nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The Lord their God is with them, acclaimed as a king among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-22">God, who brings them out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-23">Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘See what God has done!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-24">Look, a people rising up like a lioness, and rousing itself like a lion! It does not lie down until it has eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-25">Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-26">But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘Whatever the Lord says, that is what I must do’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-27">So Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-28">So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-29">Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-30">So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
