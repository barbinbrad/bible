And he went to a bare height.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-4">And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-5">And Jehovah put a word in Balaamâ€™s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-6">And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-7">And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-8">How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-9">For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-10">Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-11">And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-12">And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-13">And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-14">And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-15">And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet  yonder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-16">And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-17">And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-18">And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-19">God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-20">Behold, I have received  to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-21">He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-22">God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-23">Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-24">Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-25">And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-26">But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-27">And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-28">And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-29">And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-23-30">And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
