These were born to David in Hebron.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-6">While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-7">Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ishbaal said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-8">The words of Ishbaal made Abner very angry; he said, “Am I a dog’s head for Judah? Today I keep showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me now with a crime concerning this woman.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-9">So may God do to Abner and so may he add to it! For just what the Lord has sworn to David, that will I accomplish for him,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-11">And Ishbaal could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-12">Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron, saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and I will give you my support to bring all Israel over to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-13">He said, “Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall never appear in my presence unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to see me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-14">Then David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ishbaal, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I became engaged at the price of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-15">Ishbaal sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-16">But her husband went with her, weeping as he walked behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back home!” So he went back.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-17">Abner sent word to the elders of Israel, saying, “For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-18">Now then bring it about; for the Lord has promised David: Through my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from all their enemies.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-19">Abner also spoke directly to the Benjaminites; then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin were ready to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-20">When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-21">Abner said to David, “Let me go and rally all Israel to my lord the king, in order that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he went away in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-22">Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for David had dismissed him, and he had gone away in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-23">When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, “Abner son of Ner came to the king, and he has dismissed him, and he has gone away in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-24">Then Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you; why did you dismiss him, so that he got away?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-25">You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you, and to learn your comings and goings and to learn all that you are doing.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-26">When Joab came out from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-27">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway to speak with him privately, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. So he died for shedding the blood of Asahel, Joab’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-28">Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the Lord for the blood of Abner son of Ner.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-29">May the guilt fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks food!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-30">So Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-31">Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourn over Abner.” And King David followed the bier.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-32">They buried Abner at Hebron. The king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-33">The king lamented for Abner, saying, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-34">Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen.” And all the people wept over him again. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-35">Then all the people came to persuade David to eat something while it was still day; but David swore, saying, “So may God do to me, and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-36">All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; just as everything the king did pleased all the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-38">And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-39">Today I am powerless, even though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too violent for me. The Lord pay back the one who does wickedly in accordance with his wickedness!”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
