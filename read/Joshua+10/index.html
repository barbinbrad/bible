Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in midheaven, and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. &nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-14">There has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord heeded a human voice; for the Lord fought for Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-15">Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-16">Meanwhile, these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-17">And it was told Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-18">Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-19">but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Do not let them enter their towns, for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-20">When Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great slaughter on them, until they were wiped out, and when the survivors had entered into the fortified towns,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-21">all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah; no one dared to speak against any of the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-22">Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-23">They did so, and brought the five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-24">When they brought the kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the Israelites, and said to the chiefs of the warriors who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-25">And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous; for thus the Lord will do to all the enemies against whom you fight.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-26">Afterward Joshua struck them down and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-27">At sunset Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves; they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-28">Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed every person in it; he left no one remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-29">Then Joshua passed on from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-30">The Lord gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left no one remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-31">Next Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and laid siege to it, and assaulted it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-32">The Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-33">Then King Horam of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, leaving him no survivors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-34">From Lachish Joshua passed on with all Israel to Eglon; and they laid siege to it, and assaulted it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-35">and they took it that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword; and every person in it he utterly destroyed that day, as he had done to Lachish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-36">Then Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron; they assaulted it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-37">and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it; he left no one remaining, just as he had done to Eglon, and utterly destroyed it with every person in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-38">Then Joshua, with all Israel, turned back to Debir and assaulted it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-39">and he took it with its king and all its towns; they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person in it; he left no one remaining; just as he had done to Hebron, and, as he had done to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and its king.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-40">So Joshua defeated the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-41">And Joshua defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-42">Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-43">Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Joshua+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
