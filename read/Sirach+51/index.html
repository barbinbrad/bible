I give thanks to your name,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-2">for you have been my protector and helper and have delivered me from destruction and from the trap laid by a slanderous tongue, from lips that fabricate lies. In the face of my adversaries you have been my helper &nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-3">and delivered me, in the greatness of your mercy and of your name, from grinding teeth about to devour me, from the hand of those seeking my life, from the many troubles I endured,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-4">from choking fire on every side, and from the midst of fire that I had not kindled,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-5">from the deep belly of Hades, from an unclean tongue and lying words—&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-6">the slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king. My soul drew near to death, and my life was on the brink of Hades below.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-7">They surrounded me on every side, and there was no one to help me; I looked for human assistance, and there was none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-8">Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord, and your kindness from of old, for you rescue those who wait for you and save them from the hand of their enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-9">And I sent up my prayer from the earth, and begged for rescue from death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-10">I cried out, “Lord, you are my Father; do not forsake me in the days of trouble, when there is no help against the proud.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-11">I will praise your name continually, and will sing hymns of thanksgiving.” My prayer was heard,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-12">for you saved me from destruction and rescued me in time of trouble. For this reason I thank you and praise you, and I bless the name of the Lord.                                &nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-13">While I was still young, before I went on my travels, I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-14">Before the temple I asked for her, and I will search for her until the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-15">From the first blossom to the ripening grape my heart delighted in her; my foot walked on the straight path; from my youth I followed her steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-16">I inclined my ear a little and received her, and I found for myself much instruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-17">I made progress in her; to him who gives wisdom I will give glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-18">For I resolved to live according to wisdom, and I was zealous for the good, and I shall never be disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-19">My soul grappled with wisdom, and in my conduct I was strict; I spread out my hands to the heavens, and lamented my ignorance of her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-20">I directed my soul to her, and in purity I found her. With her I gained understanding from the first; therefore I will never be forsaken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-21">My heart was stirred to seek her; therefore I have gained a prize possession.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-22">The Lord gave me my tongue as a reward, and I will praise him with it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-23">Draw near to me, you who are uneducated, and lodge in the house of instruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-24">Why do you say you are lacking in these things, and why do you endure such great thirst?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-25">I opened my mouth and said, Acquire wisdom for yourselves without money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-26">Put your neck under her yoke, and let your souls receive instruction; it is to be found close by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-27">See with your own eyes that I have labored but little and found for myself much serenity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-28">Hear but a little of my instruction, and through me you will acquire silver and gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-29">May your soul rejoice in God’s mercy, and may you never be ashamed to praise him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-51-30">Do your work in good time, and in his own time God will give you your reward.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+50/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
