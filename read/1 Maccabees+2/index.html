Why was I born to see this, the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city, and to live there when it was given over to the enemy, the sanctuary given over to aliens?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-8">Her temple has become like a person without honor;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-9">her glorious vessels have been carried into exile. Her infants have been killed in her streets, her youths by the sword of the foe.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-10">What nation has not inherited her palaces and has not seized her spoils?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-11">All her adornment has been taken away; no longer free, she has become a slave.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-12">And see, our holy place, our beauty, and our glory have been laid waste; the Gentiles have profaned them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-13">Why should we live any longer?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-14">Then Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-15">The king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town of Modein to make them offer sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-16">Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathias and his sons were assembled.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-17">Then the king’s officers spoke to Mattathias as follows: “You are a leader, honored and great in this town, and supported by sons and brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-18">Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the people of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-19">But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: “Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to obey his commandments, every one of them abandoning the religion of their ancestors,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-20">I and my sons and my brothers will continue to live by the covenant of our ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-21">Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-22">We will not obey the king’s words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-23">When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein, according to the king’s command.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-24">When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him on the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-25">At the same time he killed the king’s officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-26">Thus he burned with zeal for the law, just as Phinehas did against Zimri son of Salu.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-27">Then Mattathias cried out in the town with a loud voice, saying: “Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-28">Then he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the town.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-29">At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-30">they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-31">And it was reported to the king’s officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that those who had rejected the king’s command had gone down to the hiding places in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-32">Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-33">They said to them, “Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-34">But they said, “We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-35">Then the enemy quickly attacked them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-36">But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding places,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-37">for they said, “Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-38">So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and livestock, to the number of a thousand persons.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-39">When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-40">And all said to their neighbors: “If we all do as our kindred have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-41">So they made this decision that day: “Let us fight against anyone who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our kindred died in their hiding places.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-42">Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, all who offered themselves willingly for the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-43">And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-44">They organized an army, and struck down sinners in their anger and renegades in their wrath; the survivors fled to the Gentiles for safety.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-45">And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-46">they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-47">They hunted down the arrogant, and the work prospered in their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-48">They rescued the law out of the hands of the Gentiles and kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-49">Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: “Arrogance and scorn have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-50">Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-51">“Remember the deeds of the ancestors, which they did in their generations; and you will receive great honor and an everlasting name.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-52">Was not Abraham found faithful when tested, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-53">Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and became lord of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-54">Phinehas our ancestor, because he was deeply zealous, received the covenant of everlasting priesthood.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-55">Joshua, because he fulfilled the command, became a judge in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-56">Caleb, because he testified in the assembly, received an inheritance in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-57">David, because he was merciful, inherited the throne of the kingdom forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-58">Elijah, because of great zeal for the law, was taken up into heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-59">Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael believed and were saved from the flame.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-60">Daniel, because of his innocence, was delivered from the mouth of the lions.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-61">“And so observe, from generation to generation, that none of those who put their trust in him will lack strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-62">Do not fear the words of sinners, for their splendor will turn into dung and worms.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-63">Today they will be exalted, but tomorrow they will not be found, because they will have returned to the dust, and their plans will have perished.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-64">My children, be courageous and grow strong in the law, for by it you will gain honor.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-65">“Here is your brother Simeon who, I know, is wise in counsel; always listen to him; he shall be your father.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-66">Judas Maccabeus has been a mighty warrior from his youth; he shall command the army for you and fight the battle against the peoples.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-67">You shall rally around you all who observe the law, and avenge the wrong done to your people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-68">Pay back the Gentiles in full, and obey the commands of the law.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-69">Then he blessed them, and was gathered to his ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-2-70">He died in the one hundred forty-sixth year and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors at Modein. And all Israel mourned for him with great lamentation.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
