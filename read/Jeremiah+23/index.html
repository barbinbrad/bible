And they shall dwell in their own land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-9">Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-10">For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-11">for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-12">Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-13">And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-14">In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-15">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-16">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-17">They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-18">For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-19">Behold, the tempest of Jehovah,  wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-20">The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-21">I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-22">But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-23">Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-24">Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-25">I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-26">How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-27">that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-28">The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-29">Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-30">Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-31">Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-32">Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-33">And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-34">And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-35">Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-36">And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every manâ€™s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-37">Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-38">But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-39">therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-23-40">and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
