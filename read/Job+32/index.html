He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-3">he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-5">But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-6">Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered: “I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-7">I said, ‘Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-8">But truly it is the spirit in a mortal, the breath of the Almighty, that makes for understanding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-9">It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-10">Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-11">“See, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-12">I gave you my attention, but there was in fact no one that confuted Job, no one among you that answered his words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-13">Yet do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a human.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-14">He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-15">“They are dismayed, they answer no more; they have not a word to say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-16">And am I to wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-17">I also will give my answer; I also will declare my opinion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-18">For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-19">My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-20">I must speak, so that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-21">I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward anyone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-22">For I do not know how to flatter— or my Maker would soon put an end to me!&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
