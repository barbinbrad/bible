Search its squares and see if you can find one person who acts justly and seeks truth— so that I may pardon Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-2">Although they say, “As the Lord lives,” yet they swear falsely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-3">O Lord, do your eyes not look for truth? You have struck them, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to turn back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-4">Then I said, “These are only the poor, they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the Lord, the law of their God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-5">Let me go to the rich and speak to them; surely they know the way of the Lord, the law of their God.” But they all alike had broken the yoke, they had burst the bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-6">Therefore a lion from the forest shall kill them, a wolf from the desert shall destroy them. A leopard is watching against their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces— because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-7">How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of prostitutes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-8">They were well-fed lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor’s wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-9">Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord; and shall I not bring retribution on a nation such as this?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-10">Go up through her vine-rows and destroy, but do not make a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the Lord’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly faithless to me, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-12">They have spoken falsely of the Lord, and have said, “He will do nothing. No evil will come upon us, and we shall not see sword or famine.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-13">The prophets are nothing but wind, for the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-14">Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts: Because they have spoken this word, I am now making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall devour them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-15">I am going to bring upon you a nation from far away, O house of Israel, says the Lord. It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-16">Their quiver is like an open tomb; all of them are mighty warriors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-17">They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; they shall destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-18">But even in those days, says the Lord, I will not make a full end of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-19">And when your people say, “Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us?” you shall say to them, “As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-20">Declare this in the house of Jacob, proclaim it in Judah:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-21">Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but do not see, who have ears, but do not hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-22">Do you not fear me? says the Lord; Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail, though they roar, they cannot pass over it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-23">But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-24">They do not say in their hearts, “Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-25">Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have deprived you of good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-26">For scoundrels are found among my people; they take over the goods of others. Like fowlers they set a trap; they catch human beings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-27">Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of treachery; therefore they have become great and rich,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-28">they have grown fat and sleek. They know no limits in deeds of wickedness; they do not judge with justice the cause of the orphan, to make it prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-29">Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord, and shall I not bring retribution on a nation such as this?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-30">An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-5-31">the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule as the prophets direct; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
