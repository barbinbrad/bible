One could see, therefore, the misery that had come upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-10">For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. They publicly paraded them around the city, with their babies hanging at their breasts, and then hurled them down headlong from the wall.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-11">Others who had assembled in the caves nearby, in order to observe the seventh day secretly, were betrayed to Philip and were all burned together, because their piety kept them from defending themselves, in view of their regard for that most holy day.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-12">Now I urge those who read this book not to be depressed by such calamities, but to recognize that these punishments were designed not to destroy but to discipline our people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-13">In fact, it is a sign of great kindness not to let the impious alone for long, but to punish them immediately.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-14">For in the case of the other nations the Lord waits patiently to punish them until they have reached the full measure of their sins; but he does not deal in this way with us,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-15">in order that he may not take vengeance on us afterward when our sins have reached their height.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-16">Therefore he never withdraws his mercy from us. Although he disciplines us with calamities, he does not forsake his own people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-17">Let what we have said serve as a reminder; we must go on briefly with the story.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-18">Eleazar, one of the scribes in high position, a man now advanced in age and of noble presence, was being forced to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-19">But he, welcoming death with honor rather than life with pollution, went up to the rack of his own accord, spitting out the flesh,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-20">as all ought to go who have the courage to refuse things that it is not right to taste, even for the natural love of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-21">Those who were in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring meat of his own providing, proper for him to use, and to pretend that he was eating the flesh of the sacrificial meal that had been commanded by the king,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-22">so that by doing this he might be saved from death, and be treated kindly on account of his old friendship with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-23">But making a high resolve, worthy of his years and the dignity of his old age and the gray hairs that he had reached with distinction and his excellent life even from childhood, and moreover according to the holy God-given law, he declared himself quickly, telling them to send him to Hades.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-24">“Such pretense is not worthy of our time of life,” he said, “for many of the young might suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year had gone over to an alien religion,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-25">and through my pretense, for the sake of living a brief moment longer, they would be led astray because of me, while I defile and disgrace my old age.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-26">Even if for the present I would avoid the punishment of mortals, yet whether I live or die I will not escape the hands of the Almighty.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-27">Therefore, by bravely giving up my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-28">and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws.” When he had said this, he went at once to the rack. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-29">Those who a little before had acted toward him with goodwill now changed to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their opinion sheer madness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-30">When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned aloud and said: “It is clear to the Lord in his holy knowledge that, though I might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these things because I fear him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-6-31">So in this way he died, leaving in his death an example of nobility and a memorial of courage, not only to the young but to the great body of his nation.&nbsp;</span></p><a
