Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-3">especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-4">My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-5">having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-6">And now I stand  to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-7">unto which  our twelve tribes, earnestly serving  night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-8">Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-9">I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-10">And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-11">And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-12">Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-13">at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-16">But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-17">delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-18">to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-19">Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-20">but declared both to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-21">For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-22">Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-23">how that the Christ must suffer, how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-24">And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-25">But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-26">For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-28">And Agrippa  unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-29">And Paul , I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-30">And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-31">and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-32">And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
