It is for this hope, your Excellency, that I am accused by Jews!&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-8">Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-9">“Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-10">And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-11">By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-12">“With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-13">when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-14">When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-15">I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-16">But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-17">I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles—to whom I am sending you&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-18">to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-19">“After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-20">but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-21">For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-22">To this day I have had help from God, and so I stand here, testifying to both small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would take place:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-23">that the Messiah must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-24">While he was making this defense, Festus exclaimed, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Too much learning is driving you insane!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-25">But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-26">Indeed the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-28">Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you so quickly persuading me to become a Christian?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-29">Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as I am—except for these chains.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-30">Then the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those who had been seated with them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-31">and as they were leaving, they said to one another, “This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-26-32">Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
