What can anyone do to me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-7">Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-9">Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings; for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by regulations about food, which have not benefited those who observe them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-10">We have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-11">For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-12">Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-13">Let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-14">For here we have no lasting city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-15">Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-16">Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-17">Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with sighing—for that would be harmful to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-18">Pray for us; we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-19">I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you very soon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-20">Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-21">make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will, working among us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-22">I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-23">I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free; and if he comes in time, he will be with me when I see you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-24">Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-13-25">Grace be with all of you.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../James+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
