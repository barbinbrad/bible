And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-3">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-4">And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-5">And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-6">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-7">But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for  not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-10">And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-11">And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-12">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-14">Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-15">And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-16">Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-17">And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-18">Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-19">Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-20">And Jesse took an ass  with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-21">And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-22">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-16-23">And it came to pass, when the  spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
