And Pharaoh awoke.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-5">Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-6">Then seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-7">The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-8">In the morning his spirit was troubled; so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-9">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I remember my faults today.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-10">Once Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-11">We dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-12">A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each according to his dream.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-13">As he interpreted to us, so it turned out; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-14">Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was hurriedly brought out of the dungeon. When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-15">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-16">Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not I; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-17">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-18">and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-19">Then seven other cows came up after them, poor, very ugly, and thin. Never had I seen such ugly ones in all the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-20">The thin and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-21">but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had done so, for they were still as ugly as before. Then I awoke.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-22">I fell asleep a second time and I saw in my dream seven ears of grain, full and good, growing on one stalk,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-23">and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouting after them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-24">and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. But when I told it to the magicians, there was no one who could explain it to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one and the same; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-26">The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-27">The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, as are the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind. They are seven years of famine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-28">It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-29">There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-30">After them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-31">The plenty will no longer be known in the land because of the famine that will follow, for it will be very grievous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-32">And the doubling of Pharaoh’s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-33">Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-34">Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-35">Let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-36">That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-37">The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-38">Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find anyone else like this—one in whom is the spirit of God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-39">So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-40">You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-41">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-42">Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph’s hand; he arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-43">He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command; and they cried out in front of him, “Bow the knee!” Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-44">Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-45">Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. Thus Joseph gained authority over the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-46">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-47">During the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-48">He gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-49">So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance—like the sand of the sea—that he stopped measuring it; it was beyond measure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-50">Before the years of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-51">Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s house.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-52">The second he named Ephraim, “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortunes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-53">The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-54">and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every country, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-55">When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-56">And since the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-41-57">Moreover, all the world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine became severe throughout the world.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+40/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+42/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
