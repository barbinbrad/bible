When he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-3">David said to him, “Where have you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-4">David said to him, “How did things go? Tell me!” He answered, “The army fled from the battle, but also many of the army fell and died; and Saul and his son Jonathan also died.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-5">Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-6">The young man reporting to him said, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa; and there was Saul leaning on his spear, while the chariots and the horsemen drew close to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-7">When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here sir.’&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-8">And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-9">He said to me, ‘Come, stand over me and kill me; for convulsions have seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-10">So I stood over him, and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-11">Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did the same.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-12">They mourned and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for his son Jonathan, and for the army of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-13">David said to the young man who had reported to him, “Where do you come from?” He answered, “I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-14">David said to him, “Were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-15">Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come here and strike him down.” So he struck him down and he died.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-16">David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the Lord’s anointed.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-17">David intoned this lamentation over Saul and his son Jonathan.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-18">(He ordered that The Song of the Bow be taught to the people of Judah; it is written in the Book of Jashar.) He said:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-19">Your glory, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places! How the mighty have fallen!&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-20">Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-21">You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor bounteous fields! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, anointed with oil no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, nor the sword of Saul return empty.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-23">Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-24">O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with crimson, in luxury, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-25">How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-26">I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-1-27">How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
