Live as children of light—&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-9">for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-10">Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-11">Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-12">For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-13">but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-14">for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Sleeper, awake! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-15">Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-16">making the most of the time, because the days are evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-17">So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-18">Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-19">as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-20">giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-21">Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-22">Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-23">For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-24">Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-26">in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-27">so as to present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind—yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-28">In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-29">For no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-30">because we are members of his body.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-31">“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-32">This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-5-33">Each of you, however, should love his wife as himself, and a wife should respect her husband.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ephesians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ephesians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
