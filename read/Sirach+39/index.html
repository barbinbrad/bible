His memory will not disappear, and his name will live through all generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-10">Nations will speak of his wisdom, and the congregation will proclaim his praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-11">If he lives long, he will leave a name greater than a thousand, and if he goes to rest, it is enough for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-12">I have more on my mind to express; I am full like the full moon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-13">Listen to me, my faithful children, and blossom like a rose growing by a stream of water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-14">Send out fragrance like incense, and put forth blossoms like a lily. Scatter the fragrance, and sing a hymn of praise; bless the Lord for all his works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-15">Ascribe majesty to his name and give thanks to him with praise, with songs on your lips, and with harps; this is what you shall say in thanksgiving:&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-16">“All the works of the Lord are very good, and whatever he commands will be done at the appointed time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-17">No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’— for at the appointed time all such questions will be answered. At his word the waters stood in a heap, and the reservoirs of water at the word of his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-18">When he commands, his every purpose is fulfilled, and none can limit his saving power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-19">The works of all are before him, and nothing can be hidden from his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-20">From the beginning to the end of time he can see everything, and nothing is too marvelous for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-21">No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’— for everything has been created for its own purpose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-22">“His blessing covers the dry land like a river, and drenches it like a flood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-23">But his wrath drives out the nations, as when he turned a watered land into salt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-24">To the faithful his ways are straight, but full of pitfalls for the wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-25">From the beginning good things were created for the good, but for sinners good things and bad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-26">The basic necessities of human life are water and fire and iron and salt and wheat flour and milk and honey, the blood of the grape and oil and clothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-27">All these are good for the godly, but for sinners they turn into evils.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-28">“There are winds created for vengeance, and in their anger they can dislodge mountains; on the day of reckoning they will pour out their strength and calm the anger of their Maker.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-29">Fire and hail and famine and pestilence, all these have been created for vengeance;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-30">the fangs of wild animals and scorpions and vipers, and the sword that punishes the ungodly with destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-31">They take delight in doing his bidding, always ready for his service on earth; and when their time comes they never disobey his command.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-32">So from the beginning I have been convinced of all this and have thought it out and left it in writing:&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-33">All the works of the Lord are good, and he will supply every need in its time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-34">No one can say, “This is not as good as that,” for everything proves good in its appointed time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-39-35">So now sing praise with all your heart and voice, and bless the name of the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+38/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+40/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
