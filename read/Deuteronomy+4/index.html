You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-13">He declared to you his covenant, which he charged you to observe, that is, the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two stone tablets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-14">And the Lord charged me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-15">Since you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-16">so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-17">the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-18">the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-19">And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-20">But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-21">The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the Lord your God is giving for your possession.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-22">For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-23">So be careful not to forget the covenant that the Lord your God made with you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the Lord your God has forbidden you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-24">For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-25">When you have had children and children’s children, and become complacent in the land, if you act corruptly by making an idol in the form of anything, thus doing what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and provoking him to anger,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-26">I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to occupy; you will not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-27">The Lord will scatter you among the peoples; only a few of you will be left among the nations where the Lord will lead you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-28">There you will serve other gods made by human hands, objects of wood and stone that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-29">From there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-30">In your distress, when all these things have happened to you in time to come, you will return to the Lord your God and heed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-31">Because the Lord your God is a merciful God, he will neither abandon you nor destroy you; he will not forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-32">For ask now about former ages, long before your own, ever since the day that God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of heaven to the other: has anything so great as this ever happened or has its like ever been heard of?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-33">Has any people ever heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as you have heard, and lived?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-34">Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by terrifying displays of power, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-35">To you it was shown so that you would acknowledge that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-36">From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, while you heard his words coming out of the fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-37">And because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after them. He brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-38">driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, giving you their land for a possession, as it is still today.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-39">So acknowledge today and take to heart that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-40">Keep his statutes and his commandments, which I am commanding you today for your own well-being and that of your descendants after you, so that you may long remain in the land that the Lord your God is giving you for all time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-41">Then Moses set apart on the east side of the Jordan three cities&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-42">to which a homicide could flee, someone who unintentionally kills another person, the two not having been at enmity before; the homicide could flee to one of these cities and live:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-43">Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-44">This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-45">These are the decrees and the statutes and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites when they had come out of Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-46">beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated when they came out of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-47">They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-48">from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-4-49">together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
