By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-15">Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, coming out with her water jar on her shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-16">The girl was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-17">Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me sip a little water from your jar.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-18">“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-19">When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-20">So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-21">The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-22">When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-23">and said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-24">She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-25">She added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder and a place to spend the night.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-26">The man bowed his head and worshiped the Lord&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-27">and said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the Lord has led me on the way to the house of my master’s kin.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-28">Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-29">Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-30">As soon as he had seen the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man; and there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-31">He said, “Come in, O blessed of the Lord. Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-32">So the man came into the house; and Laban unloaded the camels, and gave him straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-33">Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my errand.” He said, “Speak on.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-34">So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-35">The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-36">And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-37">My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-38">but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-39">I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-40">But he said to me, ‘The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and make your way successful. You shall get a wife for my son from my kindred, from my father’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-41">Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred; even if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-42">“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-43">I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-44">and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also”—let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-45">“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-46">She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-47">Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-48">Then I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-49">Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-50">Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing comes from the Lord; we cannot speak to you anything bad or good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-51">Look, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-52">When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-53">And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-54">Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they rose in the morning, he said, “Send me back to my master.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-55">Her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-56">But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the Lord has made my journey successful; let me go that I may go to my master.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-57">They said, “We will call the girl, and ask her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-58">And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-59">So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-60">And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-61">Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-62">Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-63">Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-64">And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-65">and said to the servant, “Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-66">And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-67">Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
