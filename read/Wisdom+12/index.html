These initiates from the midst of a heathen cult,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-6">these parents who murder helpless lives, you willed to destroy by the hands of our ancestors,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-7">so that the land most precious of all to you might receive a worthy colony of the servants of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-8">But even these you spared, since they were but mortals, and sent wasps as forerunners of your army to destroy them little by little,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-9">though you were not unable to give the ungodly into the hands of the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at one blow by dread wild animals or your stern word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-10">But judging them little by little you gave them an opportunity to repent, though you were not unaware that their origin was evil and their wickedness inborn, and that their way of thinking would never change.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-11">For they were an accursed race from the beginning, and it was not through fear of anyone that you left them unpunished for their sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-12">For who will say, “What have you done?” or will resist your judgment? Who will accuse you for the destruction of nations that you made? Or who will come before you to plead as an advocate for the unrighteous?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-13">For neither is there any god besides you, whose care is for all people, to whom you should prove that you have not judged unjustly;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-14">nor can any king or monarch confront you about those whom you have punished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-15">You are righteous and you rule all things righteously, deeming it alien to your power to condemn anyone who does not deserve to be punished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-16">For your strength is the source of righteousness, and your sovereignty over all causes you to spare all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-17">For you show your strength when people doubt the completeness of your power, and you rebuke any insolence among those who know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-18">Although you are sovereign in strength, you judge with mildness, and with great forbearance you govern us; for you have power to act whenever you choose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-19">Through such works you have taught your people that the righteous must be kind, and you have filled your children with good hope, because you give repentance for sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-20">For if you punished with such great care and indulgence the enemies of your servants and those deserving of death, granting them time and opportunity to give up their wickedness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-21">with what strictness you have judged your children, to whose ancestors you gave oaths and covenants full of good promises!&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-22">So while chastening us you scourge our enemies ten thousand times more, so that, when we judge, we may meditate upon your goodness, and when we are judged, we may expect mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-23">Therefore those who lived unrighteously, in a life of folly, you tormented through their own abominations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-24">For they went far astray on the paths of error, accepting as gods those animals that even their enemies despised; they were deceived like foolish infants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-25">Therefore, as though to children who cannot reason, you sent your judgment to mock them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-26">But those who have not heeded the warning of mild rebukes will experience the deserved judgment of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-12-27">For when in their suffering they became incensed at those creatures that they had thought to be gods, being punished by means of them, they saw and recognized as the true God the one whom they had before refused to know. Therefore the utmost condemnation came upon them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Wisdom+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
