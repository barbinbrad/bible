Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-8">The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-9">But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-10">So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-11">The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-12">But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-13">As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-14">So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-15">When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-16">Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-17">And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-18">Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-19">Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-20">God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-21">He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-22">At that time Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-23">now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have resided as an alien.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-24">And Abraham said, “I swear it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-25">When Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-26">Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-27">So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-28">Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-29">And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-30">He said, “These seven ewe lambs you shall accept from my hand, in order that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-31">Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there both of them swore an oath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-32">When they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-34">And Abraham resided as an alien many days in the land of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
