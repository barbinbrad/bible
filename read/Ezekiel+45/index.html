and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-3">And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-4">It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-5">And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, twenty chambers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-6">And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-7">And  for the prince  on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-8">In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-9">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-10">Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-11">The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-12">And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-13">This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-14">and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor,  ten baths, even a homer (for ten baths are a homer);&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-15">and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel;—for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-16">All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-17">And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-18">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first , in the first  of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-19">And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-20">And so thou shalt do on the seventh  of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-21">In the first , in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-22">And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-23">And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-24">And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-45-25">In the seventh , in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days;
