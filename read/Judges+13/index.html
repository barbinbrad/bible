His wife was barren, having borne no children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-3">And the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, “Although you are barren, having borne no children, you shall conceive and bear a son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-4">Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or to eat anything unclean,&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-5">for you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor is to come on his head, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth. It is he who shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-6">Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, most awe-inspiring; I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name;&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-7">but he said to me, ‘You shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-8">Then Manoah entreated the Lord, and said, “O Lord, I pray, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-9">God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-10">So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-11">Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-12">Then Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy’s rule of life; what is he to do?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-13">The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “Let the woman give heed to all that I said to her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-14">She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine. She is not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She is to observe everything that I commanded her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-15">Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, “Allow us to detain you, and prepare a kid for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-16">The angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “If you detain me, I will not eat your food; but if you want to prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the Lord.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-17">Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your words come true?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-18">But the angel of the Lord said to him, “Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-19">So Manoah took the kid with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord, to him who works wonders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-20">When the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar while Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-21">The angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah realized that it was the angel of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-22">And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-23">But his wife said to him, “If the Lord had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-24">The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the Lord blessed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-13-25">The spirit of the Lord began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Judges+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judges+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
