The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-4">The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-5">Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-6">But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-7">This is the length of Abraham’s life, one hundred seventy-five years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-8">Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-9">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-10">the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-11">After the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-12">These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave-girl, bore to Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-16">These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-17">(This is the length of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty-seven years; he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-18">They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria; he settled down alongside of all his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-19">These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-20">and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-21">Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-22">The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is to be this way, why do I live?” So she went to inquire of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-23">And the Lord said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-24">When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-25">The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-26">Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-27">When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-28">Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-29">Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-30">Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!” (Therefore he was called Edom.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-31">Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-32">Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-33">Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-25-34">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
