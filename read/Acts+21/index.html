for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-15">And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-16">And there went with us also  of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing  one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-17">And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-18">And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-19">And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-20">And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-21">and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-22">What is it therefore? they will certainly hear that thou art come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-23">Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-24">these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-25">But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-27">And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-28">crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-29">For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-30">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-31">And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-32">And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-33">Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-34">And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-35">And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-36">for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-37">And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-38">Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-39">But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-40">And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
