What has come into being&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-4">in him was life, and the life was the light of all people.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-5">The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-7">He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-8">He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-9">The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-10">He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-11">He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-12">But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-13">who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-14">And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-15">(John testified to him and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’”)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-16">From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-17">The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-18">No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, who has made him known.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-19">This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-20">He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-21">And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-22">Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-23">He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’” as the prophet Isaiah said.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-24">Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-25">They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-26">John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-27">the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-28">This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-29">The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-30">This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-31">I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-32">And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-33">I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-34">And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-35">The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-36">and as he watched Jesus walk by, he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb of God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-37">The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-38">When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-39">He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-40">One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-41">He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-42">He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-43">The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-46">Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-47">When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-48">Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-49">Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-50">Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-51">And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
