You have made it clear today that commanders and officers are nothing to you; for I perceive that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-7">So go out at once and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the Lord, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night; and this will be worse for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your youth until now.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-8">Then the king got up and took his seat in the gate. The troops were all told, “See, the king is sitting in the gate”; and all the troops came before the king. Meanwhile, all the Israelites had fled to their homes. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-9">All the people were disputing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and saved us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-10">But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-11">King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-12">You are my kin, you are my bone and my flesh; why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-13">And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? So may God do to me, and more, if you are not the commander of my army from now on, in place of Joab.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-14">Amasa swayed the hearts of all the people of Judah as one, and they sent word to the king, “Return, both you and all your servants.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-15">So the king came back to the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring him over the Jordan.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-16">Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the people of Judah to meet King David;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-17">with him were a thousand people from Benjamin. And Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-18">while the crossing was taking place, to bring over the king’s household, and to do his pleasure. Shimei son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan, &nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-19">and said to the king, “May my lord not hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem; may the king not bear it in mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-20">For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, see, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-21">Abishai son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord’s anointed?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-22">But David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today become an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-23">The king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king gave him his oath.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-24">Mephibosheth grandson of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes, from the day the king left until the day he came back in safety.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-25">When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-26">He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said to him, ‘Saddle a donkey for me, so that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ For your servant is lame.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-27">He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-28">For all my father’s house were doomed to death before my lord the king; but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to appeal to the king?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-29">The king said to him, “Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-30">Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take it all, since my lord the king has arrived home safely.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-31">Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-32">Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-33">The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will provide for you in Jerusalem at my side.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-34">But Barzillai said to the king, “How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-35">Today I am eighty years old; can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-36">Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king recompense me with such a reward?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-37">Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own town, near the graves of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do for him whatever seems good to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-38">The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you; and all that you desire of me I will do for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-39">Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed over; the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-40">The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; all the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-41">Then all the people of Israel came to the king, and said to him, “Why have our kindred the people of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-42">All the people of Judah answered the people of Israel, “Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense? Or has he given us any gift?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-19-43">But the people of Israel answered the people of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?” But the words of the people of Judah were fiercer than the words of the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
