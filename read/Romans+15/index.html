As it is written, “Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name”;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-10">and again he says, “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people”;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-11">and again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him”;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-12">and again Isaiah says, “The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-13">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-14">I myself feel confident about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-15">Nevertheless on some points I have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-17">In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast of my work for God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-18">For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-19">by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far around as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-20">Thus I make it my ambition to proclaim the good news, not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on someone else’s foundation,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-21">but as it is written, “Those who have never been told of him shall see, and those who have never heard of him shall understand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-22">This is the reason that I have so often been hindered from coming to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-23">But now, with no further place for me in these regions, I desire, as I have for many years, to come to you&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-24">when I go to Spain. For I do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a little while.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-25">At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem in a ministry to the saints;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-26">for Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-27">They were pleased to do this, and indeed they owe it to them; for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-28">So, when I have completed this, and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will set out by way of you to Spain;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-29">and I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-30">I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-31">that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-32">so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-33">The God of peace be with all of you.
