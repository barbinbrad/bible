but the body is Christâ€™s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-18">Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-19">and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-20">If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-21">Handle not, nor taste, nor touch&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-22">(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-2-23">Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body;
