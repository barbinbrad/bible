Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-6">But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-7">Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-8">You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-9">But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-10">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-11">For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-12">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-13">For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-14">What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-15">If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-16">and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,” and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-17">So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-18">But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-19">You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-20">Do you want to be shown, you senseless person, that faith apart from works is barren?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-21">Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-22">You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by the works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-23">Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-24">You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-25">Likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-26">For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../James+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../James+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
