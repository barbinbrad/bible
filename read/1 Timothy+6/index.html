Teach and urge these duties. &nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-3">Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-4">is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words. From these come envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-5">and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-6">Of course, there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-7">for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-8">but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-9">But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-10">For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-11">But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-12">Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-13">In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-14">to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-15">which he will bring about at the right timeâ€”he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-16">It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-17">As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-18">They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-19">thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-20">Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-6-21">by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith. Grace be with you.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Timothy+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Timothy+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
