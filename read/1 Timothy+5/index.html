for this is pleasing in God’s sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-5">The real widow, left alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-6">but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-7">Give these commands as well, so that they may be above reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-8">And whoever does not provide for relatives, and especially for family members, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-9">Let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-10">she must be well attested for her good works, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints’ feet, helped the afflicted, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-11">But refuse to put younger widows on the list; for when their sensual desires alienate them from Christ, they want to marry,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-12">and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-13">Besides that, they learn to be idle, gadding about from house to house; and they are not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not say.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-14">So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, and manage their households, so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-15">For some have already turned away to follow Satan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-16">If any believing woman has relatives who are really widows, let her assist them; let the church not be burdened, so that it can assist those who are real widows.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-17">Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-18">for the scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves to be paid.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-19">Never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-20">As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest also may stand in fear.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-21">In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, I warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-22">Do not ordain anyone hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-23">No longer drink only water, but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-24">The sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment, while the sins of others follow them there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Tim-5-25">So also good works are conspicuous; and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Timothy+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Timothy+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
