Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-4">Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me.” And they came closer. He said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-5">And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-6">For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-7">God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-8">So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-9">Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-10">You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-11">I will provide for you there—since there are five more years of famine to come—so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-12">And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my own mouth that speaks to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-13">You must tell my father how greatly I am honored in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-14">Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-15">And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-16">When the report was heard in Pharaoh’s house, “Joseph’s brothers have come,” Pharaoh and his servants were pleased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-17">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your animals and go back to the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-18">Take your father and your households and come to me, so that I may give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you may enjoy the fat of the land.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-19">You are further charged to say, ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-20">Give no thought to your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-21">The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons according to the instruction of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-22">To each one of them he gave a set of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of garments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-23">To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-24">Then he sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Do not quarrel along the way.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-25">So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-26">And they told him, “Joseph is still alive! He is even ruler over all the land of Egypt.” He was stunned; he could not believe them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-27">But when they told him all the words of Joseph that he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-45-28">Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I must go and see him before I die.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+44/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+46/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
