And Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-17">And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovah’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-18">And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-19">And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-20">And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-21">And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-22">And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-23">But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-24">And Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-13-25">And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.
