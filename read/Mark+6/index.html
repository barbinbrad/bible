They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-4">Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-5">And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-6">And he was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went about among the villages teaching. &nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-7">He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-8">He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-9">but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-10">He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-11">If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-12">So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-13">They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-14">King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; and for this reason these powers are at work in him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-15">But others said, “It is Elijah.” And others said, “It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-16">But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-17">For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-18">For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-19">And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-20">for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed; and yet he liked to listen to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-21">But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-22">When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-23">And he solemnly swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-24">She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” She replied, “The head of John the baptizer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-25">Immediately she rushed back to the king and requested, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-26">The king was deeply grieved; yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests, he did not want to refuse her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-27">Immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-28">brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-29">When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-30">The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-31">He said to them, “Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-32">And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-33">Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-34">As he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-35">When it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is now very late;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-36">send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-37">But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “Are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-38">And he said to them, “How many loaves have you? Go and see.” When they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-39">Then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-40">So they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-41">Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-42">And all ate and were filled;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-43">and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-44">Those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-45">Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-46">After saying farewell to them, he went up on the mountain to pray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-47">When evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-48">When he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind, he came towards them early in the morning, walking on the sea. He intended to pass them by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-49">But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-50">for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-51">Then he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-52">for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-53">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored the boat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-54">When they got out of the boat, people at once recognized him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-55">and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-56">And wherever he went, into villages or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
