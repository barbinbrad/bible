And they were offended in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-4">And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-5">And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-6">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-7">And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-8">and he charged them that they should take nothing for  journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-9">but  shod with sandals: and, , put not on two coats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-10">And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-11">And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-12">And they went out, and preached that  should repent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-13">And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-14">And king Herod heard ; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-15">But others said, It is Elijah. And others said,  a prophet,  as one of the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-16">But Herod, when he heard , said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-17">For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-18">For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-19">And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-20">for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-21">And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-22">and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-23">And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-24">And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-25">And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-26">And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-27">And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-28">and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-29">And when his disciples heard , they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-30">And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-31">And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-32">And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-33">And  saw them going, and many knew , and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-34">And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-35">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-36">send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-37">But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-38">And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go  see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-39">And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-40">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-41">And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-42">And they all ate, and were filled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-43">And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-44">And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-45">And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before  unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-46">And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-47">And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-48">And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-49">but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-50">for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-51">And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-52">for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-53">And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-54">And when they were come out of the boat, straightway  knew him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-55">and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-6-56">And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
