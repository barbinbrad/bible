I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-8">For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-9">Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-10">He begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-11">Now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-12">and the unclean spirits begged him, “Send us into the swine; let us enter them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-13">So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-14">The swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came to see what it was that had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-15">They came to Jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-16">Those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-17">Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighborhood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-18">As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-19">But Jesus refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-20">And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-21">When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-22">Then one of the leaders of the synagogue named Jairus came and, when he saw him, fell at his feet&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-23">and begged him repeatedly, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-24">So he went with him. And a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him. &nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-25">Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-26">She had endured much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had; and she was no better, but rather grew worse.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-27">She had heard about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-28">for she said, “If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-29">Immediately her hemorrhage stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-30">Immediately aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-31">And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say, ‘Who touched me?’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-32">He looked all around to see who had done it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-33">But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-34">He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-35">While he was still speaking, some people came from the leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-36">But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-37">He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-38">When they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue, he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-39">When he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-40">And they laughed at him. Then he put them all outside, and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-41">He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha cum,” which means, “Little girl, get up!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-42">And immediately the girl got up and began to walk about (she was twelve years of age). At this they were overcome with amazement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-43">He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
