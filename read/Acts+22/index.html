Then he said:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-3">“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated strictly according to our ancestral law, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-4">I persecuted this Way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-5">as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to Jerusalem for punishment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-6">“While I was on my way and approaching Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-8">I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ Then he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-9">Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-10">I asked, ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go to Damascus; there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-11">Since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, those who were with me took my hand and led me to Damascus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-12">“A certain Ananias, who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews living there,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-13">came to me; and standing beside me, he said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ In that very hour I regained my sight and saw him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-14">Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear his own voice;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-15">for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-16">And now why do you delay? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away, calling on his name.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-17">“After I had returned to Jerusalem and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-18">and saw Jesus saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-19">And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-20">And while the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing by, approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-21">Then he said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-22">Up to this point they listened to him, but then they shouted, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-23">And while they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and tossing dust into the air,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-24">the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by flogging, to find out the reason for this outcry against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-25">But when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who is uncondemned?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-26">When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-27">The tribune came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-28">The tribune answered, “It cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship.” Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-29">Immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-22-30">Since he wanted to find out what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet. He brought Paul down and had him stand before them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
