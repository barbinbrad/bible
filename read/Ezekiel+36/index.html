They shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-12">I will lead people upon you—my people Israel—and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance. No longer shall you bereave them of children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-13">Thus says the Lord God: Because they say to you, “You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-14">therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, says the Lord God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-15">and no longer will I let you hear the insults of the nations, no longer shall you bear the disgrace of the peoples; and no longer shall you cause your nation to stumble, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-16">The word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-17">Mortal, when the house of Israel lived on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds; their conduct in my sight was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual period.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-18">So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-19">I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-20">But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, “These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go out of his land.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-21">But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-22">Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-23">I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-24">I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-25">I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-26">A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-27">I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-28">Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-29">I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-30">I will make the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field abundant, so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-31">Then you shall remember your evil ways, and your dealings that were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable deeds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-32">It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord God; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and dismayed for your ways, O house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-33">Thus says the Lord God: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the towns to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-34">The land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-35">And they will say, “This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are now inhabited and fortified.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-36">Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-37">Thus says the Lord God: I will also let the house of Israel ask me to do this for them: to increase their population like a flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-38">Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so shall the ruined towns be filled with flocks of people. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+37/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
