for they are at hand to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-9">For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-10">and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-11">and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better  than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-12">Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-13">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou  art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-14">therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-15">neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-16">Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-17">Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-18">Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-19">and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-20">And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-21">But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-22">Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not  for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-23">And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-24">For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-25">And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-26">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-27">And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-28">And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-29">And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-30">And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-31">Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-32">Not for your sake do I , saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-33">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-34">And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-35">And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-36">Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-37">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-36-38">As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+37/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
