He sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-8">Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-9">Go therefore into the main streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-10">Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-11">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-12">and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ And he was speechless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-13">Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-14">For many are called, but few are chosen.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-15">Then the Pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-16">So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-17">Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-18">But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-19">Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-20">Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-21">They answered, “The emperor’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-22">When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-23">The same day some Sadducees came to him, saying there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-24">“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies childless, his brother shall marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-25">Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died childless, leaving the widow to his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-26">The second did the same, so also the third, down to the seventh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-27">Last of all, the woman herself died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-28">In the resurrection, then, whose wife of the seven will she be? For all of them had married her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-29">Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-30">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-31">And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-32">‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is God not of the dead, but of the living.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-33">And when the crowd heard it, they were astounded at his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-34">When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-35">and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-36">“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-37">He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-38">This is the greatest and first commandment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-39">And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-42">“What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-43">He said to them, “How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-44">‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet”’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-45">If David thus calls him Lord, how can he be his son?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-46">No one was able to give him an answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
