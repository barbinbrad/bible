to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who approach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-2">Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered, since the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-3">But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-5">Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-6">in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-7">Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-8">When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law),&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-9">then he added, “See, I have come to do your will.” He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-10">And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-11">And every priest stands day after day at his service, offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-12">But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, “he sat down at the right hand of God,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-13">and since then has been waiting “until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-14">For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-15">And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-16">“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-17">he also adds, “I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-18">Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-19">Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-20">by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-22">let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-23">Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-24">And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-25">not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-26">For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-27">but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-28">Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-29">How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-30">For we know the one who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-32">But recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-33">sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-34">For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-35">Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-36">For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-37">For yet “in a very little while, the one who is coming will come and will not delay;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-38">but my righteous one will live by faith. My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-39">But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
