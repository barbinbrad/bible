Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-15">And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-16">And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-17">And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-18">And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-19">And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-20">And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-21">And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-22">And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-23">And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-24">and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-25">And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-26">Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-27">And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, :  I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-28">And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-29">And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-30">For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-31">And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-32">I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and  shall be my hire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-33">So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that,  with me, shall be counted stolen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-34">And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-35">And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-36">and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-37">And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-38">And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-39">And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-40">And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-41">And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-42">but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-43">And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+29/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
