So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-5">And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-6">He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-7">And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-8">and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-9">and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-10">and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-11">And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-12">And in every city  shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-13">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-14">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priestâ€™s office unto Jehovah;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-15">and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-16">And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-18">And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David,  Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-19">and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-20">And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-21">And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters).&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-22">And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief,  the prince among his brethren; for  to make him king.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-11-23">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance.
