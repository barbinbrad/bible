So he fled and in great disappointment left there to return to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-5">Then someone came to him in Persia and reported that the armies that had gone into the land of Judah had been routed;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-6">that Lysias had gone first with a strong force, but had turned and fled before the Jews; that the Jews had grown strong from the arms, supplies, and abundant spoils that they had taken from the armies they had cut down;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-7">that they had torn down the abomination that he had erected on the altar in Jerusalem; and that they had surrounded the sanctuary with high walls as before, and also Beth-zur, his town.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-8">When the king heard this news, he was astounded and badly shaken. He took to his bed and became sick from disappointment, because things had not turned out for him as he had planned.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-9">He lay there for many days, because deep disappointment continually gripped him, and he realized that he was dying.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-10">So he called all his Friends and said to them, “Sleep has departed from my eyes and I am downhearted with worry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-11">I said to myself, ‘To what distress I have come! And into what a great flood I now am plunged! For I was kind and beloved in my power.’&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-12">But now I remember the wrong I did in Jerusalem. I seized all its vessels of silver and gold, and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judah without good reason.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-13">I know that it is because of this that these misfortunes have come upon me; here I am, perishing of bitter disappointment in a strange land.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-14">Then he called for Philip, one of his Friends, and made him ruler over all his kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-15">He gave him the crown and his robe and the signet, so that he might guide his son Antiochus and bring him up to be king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-16">Thus King Antiochus died there in the one hundred forty-ninth year.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-17">When Lysias learned that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus the king’s son to reign. Lysias had brought him up from boyhood; he named him Eupator.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-18">Meanwhile the garrison in the citadel kept hemming Israel in around the sanctuary. They were trying in every way to harm them and strengthen the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-19">Judas therefore resolved to destroy them, and assembled all the people to besiege them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-20">They gathered together and besieged the citadel in the one hundred fiftieth year; and he built siege towers and other engines of war.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-21">But some of the garrison escaped from the siege and some of the ungodly Israelites joined them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-22">They went to the king and said, “How long will you fail to do justice and to avenge our kindred?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-23">We were happy to serve your father, to live by what he said, and to follow his commands.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-24">For this reason the sons of our people besieged the citadel and became hostile to us; moreover, they have put to death as many of us as they have caught, and they have seized our inheritances.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-25">It is not against us alone that they have stretched out their hands; they have also attacked all the lands on their borders.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-26">And see, today they have encamped against the citadel in Jerusalem to take it; they have fortified both the sanctuary and Beth-zur;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-27">unless you quickly prevent them, they will do still greater things, and you will not be able to stop them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-28">The king was enraged when he heard this. He assembled all his Friends, the commanders of his forces and those in authority.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-29">Mercenary forces also came to him from other kingdoms and from islands of the seas.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-30">The number of his forces was one hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants accustomed to war.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-31">They came through Idumea and encamped against Beth-zur, and for many days they fought and built engines of war; but the Jews sallied out and burned these with fire, and fought courageously.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-32">Then Judas marched away from the citadel and encamped at Beth-zechariah, opposite the camp of the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-33">Early in the morning the king set out and took his army by a forced march along the road to Beth-zechariah, and his troops made ready for battle and sounded their trumpets.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-34">They offered the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them for battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-35">They distributed the animals among the phalanxes; with each elephant they stationed a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and with brass helmets on their heads; and five hundred picked horsemen were assigned to each beast.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-36">These took their position beforehand wherever the animal was; wherever it went, they went with it, and they never left it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-37">On the elephants were wooden towers, strong and covered; they were fastened on each animal by special harness, and on each were four armed men who fought from there, and also its Indian driver.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-38">The rest of the cavalry were stationed on either side, on the two flanks of the army, to harass the enemy while being themselves protected by the phalanxes.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-39">When the sun shone on the shields of gold and brass, the hills were ablaze with them and gleamed like flaming torches.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-40">Now a part of the king’s army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-41">All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-42">But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred of the king’s army fell.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-43">Now Eleazar, called Avaran, saw that one of the animals was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-44">So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-45">He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-46">He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and he died.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-47">When the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-48">The soldiers of the king’s army went up to Jerusalem against them, and the king encamped in Judea and at Mount Zion.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-49">He made peace with the people of Beth-zur, and they evacuated the town because they had no provisions there to withstand a siege, since it was a sabbatical year for the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-50">So the king took Beth-zur and stationed a guard there to hold it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-51">Then he encamped before the sanctuary for many days. He set up siege towers, engines of war to throw fire and stones, machines to shoot arrows, and catapults.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-52">The Jews also made engines of war to match theirs, and fought for many days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-53">But they had no food in storage, because it was the seventh year; those who had found safety in Judea from the Gentiles had consumed the last of the stores.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-54">Only a few men were left in the sanctuary; the rest scattered to their own homes, for the famine proved too much for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-55">Then Lysias heard that Philip, whom King Antiochus while still living had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus to be king,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-56">had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had gone with the king, and that he was trying to seize control of the government.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-57">So he quickly gave orders to withdraw, and said to the king, to the commanders of the forces, and to the troops, “Daily we grow weaker, our food supply is scant, the place against which we are fighting is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom press urgently on us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-58">Now then let us come to terms with these people, and make peace with them and with all their nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-59">Let us agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws that we abolished that they became angry and did all these things.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-60">The speech pleased the king and the commanders, and he sent to the Jews an offer of peace, and they accepted it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-61">So the king and the commanders gave them their oath. On these conditions the Jews evacuated the stronghold.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-62">But when the king entered Mount Zion and saw what a strong fortress the place was, he broke the oath he had sworn and gave orders to tear down the wall all around.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-6-63">Then he set off in haste and returned to Antioch. He found Philip in control of the city, but he fought against him, and took the city by force.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
