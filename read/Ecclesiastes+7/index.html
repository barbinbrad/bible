and the day of death, than the day of oneâ€™s birth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-2">It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-3">Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-5">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-7">Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-8">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof;  the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-10">Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-11">Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-12">For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-13">Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything  after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-15">All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth  in his evil-doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-16">Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-17">Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-18">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-19">Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-20">Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-21">Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-22">for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-23">All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-24">That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-25">I turned about, and my heart  to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason , and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-26">And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets,  whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-27">Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher,  one thing to another, to find out the account;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-28">which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-7-29">Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ecclesiastes+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ecclesiastes+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
