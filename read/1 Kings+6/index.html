Its depth was ten cubits in front of the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-4">For the house he made windows with recessed frames.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-5">He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-6">The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-7">The house was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-8">The entrance for the middle story was on the south side of the house: one went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-9">So he built the house, and finished it; he roofed the house with beams and planks of cedar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-10">He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-11">Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-12">“Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, obey my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, then I will establish my promise with you, which I made to your father David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-13">I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-14">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-15">He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-16">He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the most holy place.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-17">The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-18">The cedar within the house had carvings of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-19">The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-20">The interior of the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-21">Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, then he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-22">Next he overlaid the whole house with gold, in order that the whole house might be perfect; even the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-23">In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-24">Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-25">The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-26">The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-27">He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one was touching the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; their other wings toward the center of the house were touching wing to wing.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-28">He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-29">He carved the walls of the house all around about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-30">The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-31">For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-32">He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-33">So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, four-sided each,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-34">and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-35">He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaying them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-36">He built the inner court with three courses of dressed stone to one course of cedar beams.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-37">In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziv.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-6-38">In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Kings+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Kings+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
