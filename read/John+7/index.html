If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-5">For even his brethren did not believe on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-6">Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-8">Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-9">And having said these things unto them, he abode  in Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-10">But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-12">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-13">Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-14">But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-15">The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-16">Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-17">If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or  I speak from myself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-18">He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-19">Did not Moses give you the law, and  none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-20">The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-21">Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-22">Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-23">If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-24">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-25">Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-26">And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-28">Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-29">I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-30">They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-31">But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-33">Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-34">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-36">What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-37">Now on the last day, the great  of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-39">But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet ; because Jesus was not yet glorified.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-40">of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-42">Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-46">The officers answered, Never man so spake.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-48">Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-49">But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-50">Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-51">Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-7-53">[And they went every man unto his own house:&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
