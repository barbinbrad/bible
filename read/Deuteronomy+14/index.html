You must not lacerate yourselves or shave your forelocks for the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-2">For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; it is you the Lord has chosen out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-3">You shall not eat any abhorrent thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-4">These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-5">the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain-sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-6">Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof cleft in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-7">Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cleft you shall not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-8">And the pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean for you. You shall not eat their meat, and you shall not touch their carcasses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-9">Of all that live in water you may eat these: whatever has fins and scales you may eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-10">And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-11">You may eat any clean birds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-12">But these are the ones that you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-13">the buzzard, the kite of any kind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-14">every raven of any kind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-15">the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk of any kind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-16">the little owl and the great owl, the water hen&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-17">and the desert owl, the carrion vulture and the cormorant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-18">the stork, the heron of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-19">And all winged insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-20">You may eat any clean winged creature.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-21">You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to aliens residing in your towns for them to eat, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-22">Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly from the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-23">In the presence of the Lord your God, in the place that he will choose as a dwelling for his name, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the firstlings of your herd and flock, so that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-24">But if, when the Lord your God has blessed you, the distance is so great that you are unable to transport it, because the place where the Lord your God will choose to set his name is too far away from you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-25">then you may turn it into money. With the money secure in hand, go to the place that the Lord your God will choose;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-26">spend the money for whatever you wish—oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink, or whatever you desire. And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your household rejoicing together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-27">As for the Levites resident in your towns, do not neglect them, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-28">Every third year you shall bring out the full tithe of your produce for that year, and store it within your towns;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-14-29">the Levites, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you, as well as the resident aliens, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, may come and eat their fill so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work that you undertake.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
