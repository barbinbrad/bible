God’s works will never be finished; and from him health spreads over all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-9">My child, when you are ill, do not delay, but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-10">Give up your faults and direct your hands rightly, and cleanse your heart from all sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-11">Offer a sweet-smelling sacrifice, and a memorial portion of choice flour, and pour oil on your offering, as much as you can afford.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-12">Then give the physician his place, for the Lord created him; do not let him leave you, for you need him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-13">There may come a time when recovery lies in the hands of physicians,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-14">for they too pray to the Lord that he grant them success in diagnosis and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-15">He who sins against his Maker, will be defiant toward the physician.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-16">My child, let your tears fall for the dead, and as one in great pain begin the lament. Lay out the body with due ceremony, and do not neglect the burial.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-17">Let your weeping be bitter and your wailing fervent; make your mourning worthy of the departed, for one day, or two, to avoid criticism; then be comforted for your grief.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-18">For grief may result in death, and a sorrowful heart saps one’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-19">When a person is taken away, sorrow is over; but the life of the poor weighs down the heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-20">Do not give your heart to grief; drive it away, and remember your own end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-21">Do not forget, there is no coming back; you do the dead no good, and you injure yourself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-22">Remember his fate, for yours is like it; yesterday it was his, and today it is yours.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-23">When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest too, and be comforted for him when his spirit has departed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-24">The wisdom of the scribe depends on the opportunity of leisure; only the one who has little business can become wise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-25">How can one become wise who handles the plow, and who glories in the shaft of a goad, who drives oxen and is occupied with their work, and whose talk is about bulls?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-26">He sets his heart on plowing furrows, and he is careful about fodder for the heifers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-27">So it is with every artisan and master artisan who labors by night as well as by day; those who cut the signets of seals, each is diligent in making a great variety; they set their heart on painting a lifelike image, and they are careful to finish their work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-28">So it is with the smith, sitting by the anvil, intent on his iron-work; the breath of the fire melts his flesh, and he struggles with the heat of the furnace; the sound of the hammer deafens his ears, and his eyes are on the pattern of the object. He sets his heart on finishing his handiwork, and he is careful to complete its decoration.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-29">So it is with the potter sitting at his work and turning the wheel with his feet; he is always deeply concerned over his products, and he produces them in quantity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-30">He molds the clay with his arm and makes it pliable with his feet; he sets his heart to finish the glazing, and he takes care in firing the kiln.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-31">All these rely on their hands, and all are skillful in their own work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-32">Without them no city can be inhabited, and wherever they live, they will not go hungry. Yet they are not sought out for the council of the people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-33">nor do they attain eminence in the public assembly. They do not sit in the judge’s seat, nor do they understand the decisions of the courts; they cannot expound discipline or judgment, and they are not found among the rulers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-38-34">But they maintain the fabric of the world, and their concern is for the exercise of their trade. How different the one who devotes himself to the study of the law of the Most High!&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+37/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+39/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
