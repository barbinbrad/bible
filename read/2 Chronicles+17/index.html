and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-6">And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-7">Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-8">and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-9">And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-10">And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-11">And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-12">And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-13">And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-14">And this was the numbering of them according to their fathersâ€™ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-15">and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-17-16">and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah;
