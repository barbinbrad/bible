I desired to take her for my bride, and became enamored of her beauty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-3">She glorifies her noble birth by living with God, and the Lord of all loves her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-4">For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and an associate in his works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-5">If riches are a desirable possession in life, what is richer than wisdom, the active cause of all things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-6">And if understanding is effective, who more than she is fashioner of what exists?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-7">And if anyone loves righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teaches self-control and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more profitable for mortals than these.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-8">And if anyone longs for wide experience, she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come; she understands turns of speech and the solutions of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and of the outcome of seasons and times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-9">Therefore I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-10">Because of her I shall have glory among the multitudes and honor in the presence of the elders, though I am young.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-11">I shall be found keen in judgment, and in the sight of rulers I shall be admired.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-12">When I am silent they will wait for me, and when I speak they will give heed; if I speak at greater length, they will put their hands on their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-13">Because of her I shall have immortality, and leave an everlasting remembrance to those who come after me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-14">I shall govern peoples, and nations will be subject to me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-15">dread monarchs will be afraid of me when they hear of me; among the people I shall show myself capable, and courageous in war.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-16">When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her; for companionship with her has no bitterness, and life with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-17">When I considered these things inwardly, and pondered in my heart that in kinship with wisdom there is immortality,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-18">and in friendship with her, pure delight, and in the labors of her hands, unfailing wealth, and in the experience of her company, understanding, and renown in sharing her words, I went about seeking how to get her for myself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-19">As a child I was naturally gifted, and a good soul fell to my lot;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-20">or rather, being good, I entered an undefiled body.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-8-21">But I perceived that I would not possess wisdom unless God gave her to me— and it was a mark of insight to know whose gift she was— so I appealed to the Lord and implored him, and with my whole heart I said:&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Wisdom+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
