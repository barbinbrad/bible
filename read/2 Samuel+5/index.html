The Lord said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-5">At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-6">The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You will not come in here, even the blind and the lame will turn you back”—thinking, “David cannot come in here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-7">Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-8">David had said on that day, “Whoever would strike down the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, those whom David hates.” Therefore it is said, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-9">David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inward.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-10">And David became greater and greater, for the Lord, the God of hosts, was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-11">King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, and carpenters and masons who built David a house.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-12">David then perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-13">In Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives; and more sons and daughters were born to David.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-14">These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-15">Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-16">Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-17">When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-18">Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-19">David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?” The Lord said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-20">So David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. He said, “The Lord has burst forth against my enemies before me, like a bursting flood.” Therefore that place is called Baal-perazim.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-21">The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-22">Once again the Philistines came up, and were spread out in the valley of Rephaim.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-23">When David inquired of the Lord, he said, “You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-24">When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then be on the alert; for then the Lord has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-5-25">David did just as the Lord had commanded him; and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
