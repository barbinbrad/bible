And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-3">Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-4">And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-5">So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought  to her, and she poured out.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-6">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-7">Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-8">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-9">And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-10">Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-11">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-13">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-14">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-15">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-16">And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-17">And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-18">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-19">And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-20">And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-21">And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut  upon him, and went out.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-22">And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-23">And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-24">Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-25">So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite: &nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-26">run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-27">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-30">And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-31">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-32">And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-33">He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-34">And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-35">Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-36">And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-37">Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-38">And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-39">And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-40">So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-41">But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-42">And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-43">And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-4-44">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Kings+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Kings+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
