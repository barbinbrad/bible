How his insolence has ceased!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-5">The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of rulers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-6">that struck down the peoples in wrath with unceasing blows, that ruled the nations in anger with unrelenting persecution.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-7">The whole earth is at rest and quiet; they break forth into singing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-8">The cypresses exult over you, the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you were laid low, no one comes to cut us down.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-9">Sheol beneath is stirred up to meet you when you come; it rouses the shades to greet you, all who were leaders of the earth; it raises from their thrones all who were kings of the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-10">All of them will speak and say to you: “You too have become as weak as we! You have become like us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-11">Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, and the sound of your harps; maggots are the bed beneath you, and worms are your covering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-12">How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-13">You said in your heart, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-14">I will ascend to the tops of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-15">But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-16">Those who see you will stare at you, and ponder over you: “Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-17">who made the world like a desert and overthrew its cities, who would not let his prisoners go home?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-18">All the kings of the nations lie in glory, each in his own tomb;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-19">but you are cast out, away from your grave, like loathsome carrion, clothed with the dead, those pierced by the sword, who go down to the stones of the Pit, like a corpse trampled underfoot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-20">You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have killed your people. May the descendants of evildoers nevermore be named!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-21">Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of their father. Let them never rise to possess the earth or cover the face of the world with cities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-22">I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts, and will cut off from Babylon name and remnant, offspring and posterity, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-23">And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the Lord of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-24">The Lord of hosts has sworn: As I have designed, so shall it be; and as I have planned, so shall it come to pass:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-25">I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains trample him under foot; his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden from their shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-26">This is the plan that is planned concerning the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-27">For the Lord of hosts has planned, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-28"> In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-29">Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken, for from the root of the snake will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying fiery serpent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-30">The firstborn of the poor will graze, and the needy lie down in safety; but I will make your root die of famine, and your remnant I will kill.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-14-31">Wail, O gate; cry, O city; melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you!
