not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-5">Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-6">Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-7">(for we walk by faith, not by sight);&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-8">we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-9">Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he hath done, whether  good or bad.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-12">We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but  as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-13">For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-15">and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-16">Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know  no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-17">Wherefore if any man is in Christ,  a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-18">But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-19">to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-20">We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech  on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-5-21">Him who knew no sin he made  sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Corinthians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
