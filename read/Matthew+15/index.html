For they do not wash their hands before they eat.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-3">He answered them, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-4">For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-5">But you say that whoever tells father or mother, ‘Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God,’ then that person need not honor the father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-6">So, for the sake of your tradition, you make void the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-7">You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-8">‘This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-9">in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-10">Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-11">it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-12">Then the disciples approached and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-13">He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-14">Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-15">But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-16">Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-17">Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-18">But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-19">For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-20">These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-21">Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-22">Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-23">But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-24">He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-25">But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-26">He answered, “It is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-27">She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-28">Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed instantly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-29">After Jesus had left that place, he passed along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up the mountain, where he sat down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-30">Great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others. They put them at his feet, and he cured them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-31">so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-32">Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-33">The disciples said to him, “Where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-34">Jesus asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-35">Then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-36">he took the seven loaves and the fish; and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-37">And all of them ate and were filled; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-38">Those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-39">After sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
