And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-7">Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-8">This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-9">But in vain do they worship me, Teaching  doctrines the precepts of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-10">And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-11">Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-12">Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-13">But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-14">Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-15">And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-16">And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-17">Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-20">these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-21">And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-22">And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-24">But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-25">But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-26">And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-27">But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-29">And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-30">And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-31">insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-32">And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-33">And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-34">And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-36">and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-37">And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-38">And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-15-39">And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
