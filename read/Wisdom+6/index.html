judges of the ends of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-2">Give ear, you that rule over multitudes, and boast of many nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-3">For your dominion was given you from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High; he will search out your works and inquire into your plans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-4">Because as servants of his kingdom you did not rule rightly, or keep the law, or walk according to the purpose of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-5">he will come upon you terribly and swiftly, because severe judgment falls on those in high places.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-6">For the lowliest may be pardoned in mercy, but the mighty will be mightily tested.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-7">For the Lord of all will not stand in awe of anyone, or show deference to greatness; because he himself made both small and great, and he takes thought for all alike.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-8">But a strict inquiry is in store for the mighty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-9">To you then, O monarchs, my words are directed, so that you may learn wisdom and not transgress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-10">For they will be made holy who observe holy things in holiness, and those who have been taught them will find a defense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-11">Therefore set your desire on my words; long for them, and you will be instructed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-12">Wisdom is radiant and unfading, and she is easily discerned by those who love her, and is found by those who seek her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-13">She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-14">One who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty, for she will be found sitting at the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-15">To fix oneâ€™s thought on her is perfect understanding, and one who is vigilant on her account will soon be free from care,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-16">because she goes about seeking those worthy of her, and she graciously appears to them in their paths, and meets them in every thought.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-17">The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction, and concern for instruction is love of her,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-18">and love of her is the keeping of her laws, and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-19">and immortality brings one near to God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-20">so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-21">Therefore if you delight in thrones and scepters, O monarchs over the peoples, honor wisdom, so that you may reign forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-22">I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be, and I will hide no secrets from you, but I will trace her course from the beginning of creation, and make knowledge of her clear, and I will not pass by the truth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-23">nor will I travel in the company of sickly envy, for envy does not associate with wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-24">The multitude of the wise is the salvation of the world, and a sensible king is the stability of any people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-6-25">Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev"
