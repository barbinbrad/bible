But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-7">But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-8">And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-9">And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest,  unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-10">And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-11">And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.]&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-12">Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-16">Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-17">Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-18">I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-19">They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-20">These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-21">He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am , ye shall die in your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-25">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-26">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-27">They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-28">Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am , and  I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-29">And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-30">As he spake these things, many believed on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word,  are ye truly my disciples;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-32">and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-33">They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-35">And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-36">If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-37">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-38">I speak the things which I have seen with  Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from  father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-39">They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-41">Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father,  God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-43">Why do ye not understand my speech?  because ye cannot hear my word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-44">Ye are of  father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-45">But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-47">He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear  not, because ye are not of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-48">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-50">But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-52">The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-55">and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-57">The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-58">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-59">They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
