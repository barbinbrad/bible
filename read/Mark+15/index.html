And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-4">And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-5">But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-6">Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-7">And there was one called Barabbas,  bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-8">And the multitude went up and began to ask him  as he was wont to do unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-12">And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-14">And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-15">And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-16">And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-17">And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-18">and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-19">And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-20">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-21">And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go , that he might bear his cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-22">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-23">And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-24">And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, the King of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-27">And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-28">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-29">save thyself, and come down from the cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-30">In like manner also the chief priests mocking  among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-31">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-32">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-33">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-34">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-35">And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-36">And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-37">And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-38">And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-39">And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom  both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-40">who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-41">And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-42">there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-43">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-44">And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-45">And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-46">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the  of Joses beheld where he was laid.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
