Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-10">Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-11">How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-12">Then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-13">Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-14">And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-15">He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-16">Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-17">And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-18">And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-20">Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-21">From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-22">And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-23">But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-24">Then Jesus told his disciples, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-25">For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-26">For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-27">“For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-16-28">Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
