Men from the citadel were his guides.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-3">But Judas heard of it, and he and his warriors moved out to attack the king’s force in Emmaus&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-4">while the division was still absent from the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-5">When Gorgias entered the camp of Judas by night, he found no one there, so he looked for them in the hills, because he said, “These men are running away from us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-6">At daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men, but they did not have armor and swords such as they desired.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-7">And they saw the camp of the Gentiles, strong and fortified, with cavalry all around it; and these men were trained in war.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-8">But Judas said to those who were with him, “Do not fear their numbers or be afraid when they charge.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-9">Remember how our ancestors were saved at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh with his forces pursued them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-10">And now, let us cry to Heaven, to see whether he will favor us and remember his covenant with our ancestors and crush this army before us today.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-11">Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-12">When the foreigners looked up and saw them coming against them,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-13">they went out from their camp to battle. Then the men with Judas blew their trumpets&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-14">and engaged in battle. The Gentiles were crushed, and fled into the plain,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-15">and all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumea, and to Azotus and Jamnia; and three thousand of them fell.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-16">Then Judas and his force turned back from pursuing them,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-17">and he said to the people, “Do not be greedy for plunder, for there is a battle before us;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-18">Gorgias and his force are near us in the hills. But stand now against our enemies and fight them, and afterward seize the plunder boldly.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-19">Just as Judas was finishing this speech, a detachment appeared, coming out of the hills.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-20">They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp, for the smoke that was seen showed what had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-21">When they perceived this, they were greatly frightened, and when they also saw the army of Judas drawn up in the plain for battle,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-22">they all fled into the land of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-23">Then Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they seized a great amount of gold and silver, and cloth dyed blue and sea purple, and great riches.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-24">On their return they sang hymns and praises to Heaven—“For he is good, for his mercy endures forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-25">Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-26">Those of the foreigners who escaped went and reported to Lysias all that had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-27">When he heard it, he was perplexed and discouraged, for things had not happened to Israel as he had intended, nor had they turned out as the king had ordered.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-28">But the next year he mustered sixty thousand picked infantry and five thousand cavalry to subdue them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-29">They came into Idumea and encamped at Beth-zur, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-30">When he saw that their army was strong, he prayed, saying, “Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who crushed the attack of the mighty warrior by the hand of your servant David, and gave the camp of the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan son of Saul, and of the man who carried his armor.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-31">Hem in this army by the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed of their troops and their cavalry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-32">Fill them with cowardice; melt the boldness of their strength; let them tremble in their destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-33">Strike them down with the sword of those who love you, and let all who know your name praise you with hymns.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-34">Then both sides attacked, and there fell of the army of Lysias five thousand men; they fell in action.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-35">When Lysias saw the rout of his troops and observed the boldness that inspired those of Judas, and how ready they were either to live or to die nobly, he withdrew to Antioch and enlisted mercenaries in order to invade Judea again with an even larger army.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-36">Then Judas and his brothers said, “See, our enemies are crushed; let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-37">So all the army assembled and went up to Mount Zion.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-38">There they saw the sanctuary desolate, the altar profaned, and the gates burned. In the courts they saw bushes sprung up as in a thicket, or as on one of the mountains. They saw also the chambers of the priests in ruins.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-39">Then they tore their clothes and mourned with great lamentation; they sprinkled themselves with ashes&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-40">and fell face down on the ground. And when the signal was given with the trumpets, they cried out to Heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-41">Then Judas detailed men to fight against those in the citadel until he had cleansed the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-42">He chose blameless priests devoted to the law,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-43">and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to an unclean place.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-44">They deliberated what to do about the altar of burnt offering, which had been profaned.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-45">And they thought it best to tear it down, so that it would not be a lasting shame to them that the Gentiles had defiled it. So they tore down the altar,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-46">and stored the stones in a convenient place on the temple hill until a prophet should come to tell what to do with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-47">Then they took unhewn stones, as the law directs, and built a new altar like the former one.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-48">They also rebuilt the sanctuary and the interior of the temple, and consecrated the courts.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-49">They made new holy vessels, and brought the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-50">Then they offered incense on the altar and lit the lamps on the lampstand, and these gave light in the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-51">They placed the bread on the table and hung up the curtains. Thus they finished all the work they had undertaken.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-52">Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is the month of Chislev, in the one hundred forty-eighth year,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-53">they rose and offered sacrifice, as the law directs, on the new altar of burnt offering that they had built.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-54">At the very season and on the very day that the Gentiles had profaned it, it was dedicated with songs and harps and lutes and cymbals.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-55">All the people fell on their faces and worshiped and blessed Heaven, who had prospered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-56">So they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and joyfully offered burnt offerings; they offered a sacrifice of well-being and a thanksgiving offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-57">They decorated the front of the temple with golden crowns and small shields; they restored the gates and the chambers for the priests, and fitted them with doors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-58">There was very great joy among the people, and the disgrace brought by the Gentiles was removed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-59">Then Judas and his brothers and all the assembly of Israel determined that every year at that season the days of dedication of the altar should be observed with joy and gladness for eight days, beginning with the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-60">At that time they fortified Mount Zion with high walls and strong towers all around, to keep the Gentiles from coming and trampling them down as they had done before.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-4-61">Judas stationed a garrison there to guard it; he also fortified Beth-zur to guard it, so that the people might have a stronghold that faced Idumea.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
