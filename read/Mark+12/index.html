And so it was with many others; some they beat, and others they killed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-6">He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-7">But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-8">So they seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-9">What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-10">Have you not read this scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-11">this was the Lord’s doing, and it is amazing in our eyes’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-12">When they realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowd. So they left him and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-13">Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-14">And they came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-15">Should we pay them, or should we not?” But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-16">And they brought one. Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?” They answered, “The emperor’s.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-17">Jesus said to them, “Give to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were utterly amazed at him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-18">Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-19">“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-20">There were seven brothers; the first married and, when he died, left no children;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-21">and the second married the widow and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-22">none of the seven left children. Last of all the woman herself died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-23">In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had married her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-24">Jesus said to them, “Is not this the reason you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-25">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-26">And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-27">He is God not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-28">One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-29">Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-30">you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-31">The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-32">Then the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that ‘he is one, and besides him there is no other’;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-33">and ‘to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,’ and ‘to love one’s neighbor as oneself,’—this is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-34">When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that no one dared to ask him any question.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said, “How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-36">David himself, by the Holy Spirit, declared, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-37">David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-38">As he taught, he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-39">and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-40">They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-41">He sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-42">A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which are worth a penny.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-43">Then he called his disciples and said to them, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-12-44">For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
