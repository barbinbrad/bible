On the day that you were created they were prepared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-14">With an anointed cherub as guardian I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the stones of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-15">You were blameless in your ways from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-16">In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian cherub drove you out from among the stones of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-17">Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-18">By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade, you profaned your sanctuaries. So I brought out fire from within you; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-19">All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-20">The word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-21">Mortal, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-22">and say, Thus says the Lord God: I am against you, O Sidon, and I will gain glory in your midst. They shall know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments in it, and manifest my holiness in it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-23">for I will send pestilence into it, and bloodshed into its streets; and the dead shall fall in its midst, by the sword that is against it on every side. And they shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-24">The house of Israel shall no longer find a pricking brier or a piercing thorn among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. And they shall know that I am the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-25">Thus says the Lord God: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall settle on their own soil that I gave to my servant Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-28-26">They shall live in safety in it, and shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall live in safety, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt.
