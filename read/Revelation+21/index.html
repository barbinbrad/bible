And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-6">And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-7">He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-8">But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part  in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-9">And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-10">And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-11">having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-12">having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are  of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-13">on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-14">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-15">And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-16">And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-17">And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits,  the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-18">And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-19">The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-20">the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-21">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-22">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-23">And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof  the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-24">And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-25">And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-26">and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-27">and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lambâ€™s book of life.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Revelation+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Revelation+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
