I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers; you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them to be false.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-3">I also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name, and that you have not grown weary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-4">But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-5">Remember then from what you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-6">Yet this is to your credit: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-7">Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To everyone who conquers, I will give permission to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-8">“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of the first and the last, who was dead and came to life:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-9">“I know your affliction and your poverty, even though you are rich. I know the slander on the part of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-10">Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Beware, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have affliction. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-11">Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-12">“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-13">“I know where you are living, where Satan’s throne is. Yet you are holding fast to my name, and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-14">But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel, so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice fornication.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-15">So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-16">Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-17">Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To everyone who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give a white stone, and on the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-18">“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-19">“I know your works—your love, faith, service, and patient endurance. I know that your last works are greater than the first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-20">But I have this against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-21">I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her fornication.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-22">Beware, I am throwing her on a bed, and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great distress, unless they repent of her doings;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-23">and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-24">But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call ‘the deep things of Satan,’ to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-25">only hold fast to what you have until I come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-26">To everyone who conquers and continues to do my works to the end, I will give authority over the nations;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-27">to rule them with an iron rod, as when clay pots are shattered—&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-28">even as I also received authority from my Father. To the one who conquers I will also give the morning star.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-2-29">Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Revelation+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Revelation+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
