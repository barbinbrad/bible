I said, “Here I am, here I am,” to a nation that did not call on my name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-2">I held out my hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-3">a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and offering incense on bricks;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-4">who sit inside tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat swine’s flesh, with broth of abominable things in their vessels;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-5">who say, “Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.” These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-6">See, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their laps&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-7">their iniquities and their ancestors’ iniquities together, says the Lord; because they offered incense on the mountains and reviled me on the hills, I will measure into their laps full payment for their actions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-8">Thus says the Lord: As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, “Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,” so I will do for my servants’ sake, and not destroy them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-9">I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-10">Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-11">But you who forsake the Lord, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-12">I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my sight, and chose what I did not delight in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-13">Therefore thus says the Lord God: My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-14">my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-15">You shall leave your name to my chosen to use as a curse, and the Lord God will put you to death; but to his servants he will give a different name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-16">Then whoever invokes a blessing in the land shall bless by the God of faithfulness, and whoever takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of faithfulness; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-17">For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-18">But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating; for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-19">I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-20">No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime; for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-21">They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-22">They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-23">They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord— and their descendants as well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-24">Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent—its food shall be dust! They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+64/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+66/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
