But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-14">When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them and cured their sick.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-15">When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is now late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-16">Jesus said to them, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-17">They replied, “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-18">And he said, “Bring them here to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-19">Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-20">And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-21">And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-22">Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-23">And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-24">but by this time the boat, battered by the waves, was far from the land, for the wind was against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-25">And early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-26">But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-28">Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-29">He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came toward Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-30">But when he noticed the strong wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-31">Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-32">When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-33">And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-34">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-35">After the people of that place recognized him, they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-14-36">and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
