Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-10">But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-12">So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh—&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-13">for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-14">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-15">For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-16">it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-17">and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ—if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-18">I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-19">For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-20">for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-21">that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-22">We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-23">and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-24">For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-27">And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-28">We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-30">And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-31">What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-32">He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-33">Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-34">Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-35">Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-36">As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-38">For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-39">nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
