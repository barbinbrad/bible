But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-25">It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-26">And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-27">Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-28">Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-29">Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-30">but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-31">But many  first shall be last; and the last first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-32">And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-33">, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-34">and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-35">And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-36">And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-37">And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on  left hand, in thy glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-38">But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-39">And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-40">but to sit on my right hand or on  left hand is not mine to give; but  for whom it hath been prepared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-41">And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-42">And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-43">But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-44">and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-45">For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-46">And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-47">And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-48">And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-49">And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-50">And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-51">And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-52">And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
