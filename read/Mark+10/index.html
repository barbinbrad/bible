And crowds again gathered around him; and, as was his custom, he again taught them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-2">Some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-3">He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-4">They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-5">But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-6">But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-7">‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-8">and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-9">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-10">Then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-11">He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-12">and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-13">People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-14">But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-15">Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-16">And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-17">As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-18">Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-19">You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-20">He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-21">Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-22">When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-23">Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-24">And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-26">They were greatly astounded and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-27">Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-28">Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-29">Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-30">who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-31">But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-32">They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-33">saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-34">they will mock him, and spit upon him, and flog him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-35">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-36">And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-37">And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-38">But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-39">They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-40">but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-41">When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-42">So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-43">But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-44">and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-45">For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-46">They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-48">Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-49">Jesus stood still and said, “Call him here.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; get up, he is calling you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-50">So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-51">Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “My teacher, let me see again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-10-52">Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
