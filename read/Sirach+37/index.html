He may cast the lot against you&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-9">and tell you, “Your way is good,” and then stand aside to see what happens to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-10">Do not consult the one who regards you with suspicion; hide your intentions from those who are jealous of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-11">Do not consult with a woman about her rival or with a coward about war, with a merchant about business or with a buyer about selling, with a miser about generosity or with the merciless about kindness, with an idler about any work or with a seasonal laborer about completing his work, with a lazy servant about a big task— pay no attention to any advice they give.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-12">But associate with a godly person whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments, who is like-minded with yourself, and who will grieve with you if you fail.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-13">And heed the counsel of your own heart, for no one is more faithful to you than it is.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-14">For our own mind sometimes keeps us better informed than seven sentinels sitting high on a watchtower.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-15">But above all pray to the Most High that he may direct your way in truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-16">Discussion is the beginning of every work, and counsel precedes every undertaking.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-17">The mind is the root of all conduct;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-18">it sprouts four branches, good and evil, life and death; and it is the tongue that continually rules them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-19">Some people may be clever enough to teach many, and yet be useless to themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-20">A skillful speaker may be hated; he will be destitute of all food,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-21">for the Lord has withheld the gift of charm, since he is lacking in all wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-22">If a person is wise to his own advantage, the fruits of his good sense will be praiseworthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-23">A wise person instructs his own people, and the fruits of his good sense will endure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-24">A wise person will have praise heaped upon him, and all who see him will call him happy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-25">The days of a person’s life are numbered, but the days of Israel are without number.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-26">One who is wise among his people will inherit honor, and his name will live forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-27">My child, test yourself while you live; see what is bad for you and do not give in to it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-28">For not everything is good for everyone, and no one enjoys everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-29">Do not be greedy for every delicacy, and do not eat without restraint;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-30">for overeating brings sickness, and gluttony leads to nausea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-37-31">Many have died of gluttony, but the one who guards against it prolongs his life.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+36/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+38/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
