The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land”),&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-4">and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-5">Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came into the wilderness where Moses was encamped at the mountain of God, bringing Moses’ sons and wife to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-6">He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, with your wife and her two sons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-7">Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed down and kissed him; each asked after the other’s welfare, and they went into the tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-8">Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had beset them on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-9">Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the Lord had done to Israel, in delivering them from the Egyptians.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-10">Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-11">Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, because he delivered the people from the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-12">And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-13">The next day Moses sat as judge for the people, while the people stood around him from morning until evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-14">When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-15">Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-16">When they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make known to them the statutes and instructions of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-17">Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-18">You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people with you. For the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-19">Now listen to me. I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You should represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases before God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-20">teach them the statutes and instructions and make known to them the way they are to go and the things they are to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-21">You should also look for able men among all the people, men who fear God, are trustworthy, and hate dishonest gain; set such men over them as officers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-22">Let them sit as judges for the people at all times; let them bring every important case to you, but decide every minor case themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-23">If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people will go to their home in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-24">So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-25">Moses chose able men from all Israel and appointed them as heads over the people, as officers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-26">And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses, but any minor case they decided themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-18-27">Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went off to his own country.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
