Like a giant he put on his breastplate; he bound on his armor of war and waged battles, protecting the camp by his sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-4">He was like a lion in his deeds, like a lion’s cub roaring for prey.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-5">He searched out and pursued those who broke the law; he burned those who troubled his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-6">Lawbreakers shrank back for fear of him; all the evildoers were confounded; and deliverance prospered by his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-7">He embittered many kings, but he made Jacob glad by his deeds, and his memory is blessed forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-8">He went through the cities of Judah; he destroyed the ungodly out of the land; thus he turned away wrath from Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-9">He was renowned to the ends of the earth; he gathered in those who were perishing.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-10">Apollonius now gathered together Gentiles and a large force from Samaria to fight against Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-11">When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him, and he defeated and killed him. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-12">Then they seized their spoils; and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and used it in battle the rest of his life.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-13">When Seron, the commander of the Syrian army, heard that Judas had gathered a large company, including a body of faithful soldiers who stayed with him and went out to battle,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-14">he said, “I will make a name for myself and win honor in the kingdom. I will make war on Judas and his companions, who scorn the king’s command.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-15">Once again a strong army of godless men went up with him to help him, to take vengeance on the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-16">When he approached the ascent of Beth-horon, Judas went out to meet him with a small company.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-17">But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, “How can we, few as we are, fight against so great and so strong a multitude? And we are faint, for we have eaten nothing today.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-18">Judas replied, “It is easy for many to be hemmed in by few, for in the sight of Heaven there is no difference between saving by many or by few.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-19">It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-20">They come against us in great insolence and lawlessness to destroy us and our wives and our children, and to despoil us;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-21">but we fight for our lives and our laws.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-22">He himself will crush them before us; as for you, do not be afraid of them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-23">When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were crushed before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-24">They pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon to the plain; eight hundred of them fell, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-25">Then Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and terror fell on the Gentiles all around them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-26">His fame reached the king, and the Gentiles talked of the battles of Judas.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-27">When King Antiochus heard these reports, he was greatly angered; and he sent and gathered all the forces of his kingdom, a very strong army.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-28">He opened his coffers and gave a year’s pay to his forces, and ordered them to be ready for any need.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-29">Then he saw that the money in the treasury was exhausted, and that the revenues from the country were small because of the dissension and disaster that he had caused in the land by abolishing the laws that had existed from the earliest days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-30">He feared that he might not have such funds as he had before for his expenses and for the gifts that he used to give more lavishly than preceding kings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-31">He was greatly perplexed in mind; then he determined to go to Persia and collect the revenues from those regions and raise a large fund.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-32">He left Lysias, a distinguished man of royal lineage, in charge of the king’s affairs from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-33">Lysias was also to take care of his son Antiochus until he returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-34">And he turned over to Lysias half of his forces and the elephants, and gave him orders about all that he wanted done. As for the residents of Judea and Jerusalem,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-35">Lysias was to send a force against them to wipe out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem; he was to banish the memory of them from the place,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-36">settle aliens in all their territory, and distribute their land by lot.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-37">Then the king took the remaining half of his forces and left Antioch his capital in the one hundred and forty-seventh year. He crossed the Euphrates river and went through the upper provinces.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-38">Lysias chose Ptolemy son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor and Gorgias, able men among the Friends of the king,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-39">and sent with them forty thousand infantry and seven thousand cavalry to go into the land of Judah and destroy it, as the king had commanded.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-40">So they set out with their entire force, and when they arrived they encamped near Emmaus in the plain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-41">When the traders of the region heard what was said to them, they took silver and gold in immense amounts, and fetters, and went to the camp to get the Israelites for slaves. And forces from Syria and the land of the Philistines joined with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-42">Now Judas and his brothers saw that misfortunes had increased and that the forces were encamped in their territory. They also learned what the king had commanded to do to the people to cause their final destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-43">But they said to one another, “Let us restore the ruins of our people, and fight for our people and the sanctuary.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-44">So the congregation assembled to be ready for battle, and to pray and ask for mercy and compassion.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-45">Jerusalem was uninhabited like a wilderness; not one of her children went in or out. The sanctuary was trampled down, and aliens held the citadel; it was a lodging place for the Gentiles. Joy was taken from Jacob; the flute and the harp ceased to play.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-46">Then they gathered together and went to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-47">They fasted that day, put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on their heads, and tore their clothes.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-48">And they opened the book of the law to inquire into those matters about which the Gentiles consulted the likenesses of their gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-49">They also brought the vestments of the priesthood and the first fruits and the tithes, and they stirred up the nazirites who had completed their days;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-50">and they cried aloud to Heaven, saying, “What shall we do with these? Where shall we take them?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-51">Your sanctuary is trampled down and profaned, and your priests mourn in humiliation.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-52">Here the Gentiles are assembled against us to destroy us; you know what they plot against us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-53">How will we be able to withstand them, if you do not help us?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-54">Then they sounded the trumpets and gave a loud shout.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-55">After this Judas appointed leaders of the people, in charge of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-56">Those who were building houses, or were about to be married, or were planting a vineyard, or were fainthearted, he told to go home again, according to the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-57">Then the army marched out and encamped to the south of Emmaus.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-58">And Judas said, “Arm yourselves and be courageous. Be ready early in the morning to fight with these Gentiles who have assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-59">It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-3-60">But as his will in heaven may be, so shall he do.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
