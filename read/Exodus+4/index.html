Who makes them mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-12">Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-13">But he said, “O my Lord, please send someone else.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-14">Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, “What of your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak fluently; even now he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you his heart will be glad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-15">You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-16">He indeed shall speak for you to the people; he shall serve as a mouth for you, and you shall serve as God for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-17">Take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-18">Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go back to my kindred in Egypt and see whether they are still living.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-19">The Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt; for all those who were seeking your life are dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-20">So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt; and Moses carried the staff of God in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-21">And the Lord said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-22">Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the Lord: Israel is my firstborn son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-23">I said to you, “Let my son go that he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-24">On the way, at a place where they spent the night, the Lord met him and tried to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-25">But Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet with it, and said, “Truly you are a bridegroom of blood to me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-26">So he let him alone. It was then she said, “A bridegroom of blood by circumcision.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-27">The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went; and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-28">Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-29">Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-30">Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-4-31">The people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had given heed to the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
