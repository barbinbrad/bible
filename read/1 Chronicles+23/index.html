These were the heads of families of Ladan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-10">And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-11">Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled as a single family.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-12">The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-13">The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, so that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the Lord, and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-14">but as for Moses the man of God, his sons were to be reckoned among the tribe of Levi.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-15">The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-16">The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-17">The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief; Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-18">The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-19">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-20">The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-23-21">The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
