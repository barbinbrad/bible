For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-17">But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-18">So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-19">But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-20">for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-21">After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-22">For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-23">After they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-24">When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-25">it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant: ‘Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-26">The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers have gathered together against the Lord and against his Messiah.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-27">For in this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-28">to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-29">And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-30">while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-31">When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-32">Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-33">With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-34">There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-35">They laid it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-36">There was a Levite, a native of Cyprus, Joseph, to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”).&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-4-37">He sold a field that belonged to him, then brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
