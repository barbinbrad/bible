And Moses prayed for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-8">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-9">And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-10">And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-11">And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-12">From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-13">From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-14">Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-15">And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-16">And from thence  to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-17">Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-18">The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre,  with their staves. And from the wilderness  to Mattanah; &nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-19">and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-20">and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-21">And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-22">Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s highway, until we have passed thy border.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-23">And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-24">And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-25">And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-26">For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-27">Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-28">For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-29">Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-30">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which  unto Medeba.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-31">Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-32">And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-33">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-34">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-35">So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
