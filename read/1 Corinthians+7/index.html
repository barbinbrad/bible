But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-8">To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-9">But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-10">To the married I give this command—not I but the Lord—that the wife should not separate from her husband&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-11">(but if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-12">To the rest I say—I and not the Lord—that if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-13">And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-14">For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-15">But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. It is to peace that God has called you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-16">Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-17">However that may be, let each of you lead the life that the Lord has assigned, to which God called you. This is my rule in all the churches.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-18">Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but obeying the commandments of God is everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-20">Let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-21">Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of your present condition now more than ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-22">For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-23">You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of human masters.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-24">In whatever condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-25">Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-26">I think that, in view of the impending crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-27">Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-28">But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin. Yet those who marry will experience distress in this life, and I would spare you that.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-29">I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-30">and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no possessions,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-31">and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-32">I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-33">but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-34">and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the Lord, so that they may be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please her husband.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-35">I say this for your own benefit, not to put any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-36">If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancée, if his passions are strong, and so it has to be, let him marry as he wishes; it is no sin. Let them marry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-37">But if someone stands firm in his resolve, being under no necessity but having his own desire under control, and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancée, he will do well.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-38">So then, he who marries his fiancée does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-39">A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-40">But in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
