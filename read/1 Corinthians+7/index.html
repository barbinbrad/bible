Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-8">But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-9">But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-10">But unto the married I give charge,  not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-11">(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-12">But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-13">And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-15">Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such : but God hath called us in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-16">For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-17">Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-18">Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-20">Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-21">Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use  rather.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-22">For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-23">Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-24">Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-26">I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, , that it is good for a man to be as he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-27">Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-28">But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-29">But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-30">and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-31">and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-32">But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-33">but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-34">and is divided.  also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-35">And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-36">But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin , if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-37">But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin , shall do well.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-38">So then both he that giveth his own virgin  in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-39">A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-7-40">But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
