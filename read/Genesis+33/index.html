So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-2">He put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-3">He himself went on ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-4">But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-5">When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-6">Then the maids drew near, they and their children, and bowed down;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-7">Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down; and finally Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-8">Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company that I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favor with my lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-9">But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-10">Jacob said, “No, please; if I find favor with you, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God—since you have received me with such favor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-11">Please accept my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I want.” So he urged him, and he took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-12">Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go alongside you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-13">But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; and if they are overdriven for one day, all the flocks will die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-14">Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-15">So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Why should my lord be so kind to me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-16">So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-17">But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore the place is called Succoth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-18">Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-19">And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, he bought for one hundred pieces of money the plot of land on which he had pitched his tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-20">There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+32/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+34/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
