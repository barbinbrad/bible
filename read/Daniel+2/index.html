When they came in and stood before the king,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-3">he said to them, “I have had such a dream that my spirit is troubled by the desire to understand it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-4">The Chaldeans said to the king (in Aramaic), “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-5">The king answered the Chaldeans, “This is a public decree: if you do not tell me both the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-6">But if you do tell me the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-7">They answered a second time, “Let the king first tell his servants the dream, then we can give its interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-8">The king answered, “I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see I have firmly decreed:&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-9">if you do not tell me the dream, there is but one verdict for you. You have agreed to speak lying and misleading words to me until things take a turn. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-10">The Chaldeans answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can reveal what the king demands! In fact no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-11">The thing that the king is asking is too difficult, and no one can reveal it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-12">Because of this the king flew into a violent rage and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-13">The decree was issued, and the wise men were about to be executed; and they looked for Daniel and his companions, to execute them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-14">Then Daniel responded with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the king’s chief executioner, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon;&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-15">he asked Arioch, the royal official, “Why is the decree of the king so urgent?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-16">So Daniel went in and requested that the king give him time and he would tell the king the interpretation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-17">Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-18">and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-19">Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-20">Daniel said: “Blessed be the name of God from age to age, for wisdom and power are his.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-21">He changes times and seasons, deposes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-22">He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-23">To you, O God of my ancestors, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and power, and have now revealed to me what we asked of you, for you have revealed to us what the king ordered.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-24">Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-25">Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can tell the king the interpretation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-26">The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-27">Daniel answered the king, “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners can show to the king the mystery that the king is asking,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-28">but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has disclosed to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at the end of days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed were these:&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-29">To you, O king, as you lay in bed, came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and the revealer of mysteries disclosed to you what is to be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-30">But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living being, but in order that the interpretation may be known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-31">“You were looking, O king, and lo! there was a great statue. This statue was huge, its brilliance extraordinary; it was standing before you, and its appearance was frightening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-32">The head of that statue was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-33">its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-34">As you looked on, a stone was cut out, not by human hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-35">Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-36">“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-37">You, O king, the king of kings—to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the might, and the glory,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-38">into whose hand he has given human beings, wherever they live, the wild animals of the field, and the birds of the air, and whom he has established as ruler over them all—you are the head of gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-39">After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over the whole earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-40">And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron; just as iron crushes and smashes everything, it shall crush and shatter all these.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-41">As you saw the feet and toes partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but some of the strength of iron shall be in it, as you saw the iron mixed with the clay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-42">As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-43">As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so will they mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-44">And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall this kingdom be left to another people. It shall crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever;&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-45">just as you saw that a stone was cut from the mountain not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has informed the king what shall be hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation trustworthy.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that a grain offering and incense be offered to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-47">The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-48">Then the king promoted Daniel, gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-2-49">Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Daniel+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Daniel+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
