He was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity became manifest.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-13">Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns on his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-14">Now King Alexander was in Cilicia at that time, because the people of that region were in revolt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-15">When Alexander heard of it, he came against him in battle. Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-16">So Alexander fled into Arabia to find protection there, and King Ptolemy was triumphant.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-17">Zabdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to Ptolemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-18">But King Ptolemy died three days later, and his troops in the strongholds were killed by the inhabitants of the strongholds.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-19">So Demetrius became king in the one hundred sixty-seventh year.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-20">In those days Jonathan assembled the Judeans to attack the citadel in Jerusalem, and he built many engines of war to use against it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-21">But certain renegades who hated their nation went to the king and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-22">When he heard this he was angry, and as soon as he heard it he set out and came to Ptolemais; and he wrote Jonathan not to continue the siege, but to meet him for a conference at Ptolemais as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-23">When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege. He chose some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests, and put himself in danger,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-24">for he went to the king at Ptolemais, taking silver and gold and clothing and numerous other gifts. And he won his favor.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-25">Although certain renegades of his nation kept making complaints against him,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-26">the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him; he exalted him in the presence of all his Friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-27">He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in as many other honors as he had formerly had, and caused him to be reckoned among his chief Friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-28">Then Jonathan asked the king to free Judea and the three districts of Samaria from tribute, and promised him three hundred talents.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-29">The king consented, and wrote a letter to Jonathan about all these things; its contents were as follows:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-30">“King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan and to the nation of the Jews, greetings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-31">This copy of the letter that we wrote concerning you to our kinsman Lasthenes we have written to you also, so that you may know what it says.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-32">‘King Demetrius to his father Lasthenes, greetings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-33">We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are our friends and fulfill their obligations to us, because of the goodwill they show toward us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-34">We have confirmed as their possession both the territory of Judea and the three districts of Aphairema and Lydda and Rathamin; the latter, with all the region bordering them, were added to Judea from Samaria. To all those who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem we have granted release from the royal taxes that the king formerly received from them each year, from the crops of the land and the fruit of the trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-35">And the other payments henceforth due to us of the tithes, and the taxes due to us, and the salt pits and the crown taxes due to us—from all these we shall grant them release.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-36">And not one of these grants shall be canceled from this time on forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-37">Now therefore take care to make a copy of this, and let it be given to Jonathan and put up in a conspicuous place on the holy mountain.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-38">When King Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him and that there was no opposition to him, he dismissed all his troops, all of them to their own homes, except the foreign troops that he had recruited from the islands of the nations. So all the troops who had served under his predecessors hated him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-39">A certain Trypho had formerly been one of Alexander’s supporters; he saw that all the troops were grumbling against Demetrius. So he went to Imalkue the Arab, who was bringing up Antiochus, the young son of Alexander,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-40">and insistently urged him to hand Antiochus over to him, to become king in place of his father. He also reported to Imalkue what Demetrius had done and told of the hatred that the troops of Demetrius had for him; and he stayed there many days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-41">Now Jonathan sent to King Demetrius the request that he remove the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops in the strongholds; for they kept fighting against Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-42">And Demetrius sent this message back to Jonathan: “Not only will I do these things for you and your nation, but I will confer great honor on you and your nation, if I find an opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-43">Now then you will do well to send me men who will help me, for all my troops have revolted.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-44">So Jonathan sent three thousand stalwart men to him at Antioch, and when they came to the king, the king rejoiced at their arrival.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-45">Then the people of the city assembled within the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand, and they wanted to kill the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-46">But the king fled into the palace. Then the people of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-47">So the king called the Jews to his aid, and they all rallied around him and then spread out through the city; and they killed on that day about one hundred thousand.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-48">They set fire to the city and seized a large amount of spoil on that day, and saved the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-49">When the people of the city saw that the Jews had gained control of the city as they pleased, their courage failed and they cried out to the king with this entreaty:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-50">“Grant us peace, and make the Jews stop fighting against us and our city.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-51">And they threw down their arms and made peace. So the Jews gained glory in the sight of the king and of all the people in his kingdom, and they returned to Jerusalem with a large amount of spoil.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-52">So King Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-53">But he broke his word about all that he had promised; he became estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors that Jonathan had done him, but treated him very harshly.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-54">After this Trypho returned, and with him the young boy Antiochus who began to reign and put on the crown.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-55">All the troops that Demetrius had discharged gathered around him; they fought against Demetrius, and he fled and was routed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-56">Trypho captured the elephants and gained control of Antioch.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-57">Then the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, “I confirm you in the high priesthood and set you over the four districts and make you one of the king’s Friends.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-58">He also sent him gold plates and a table service, and granted him the right to drink from gold cups and dress in purple and wear a gold buckle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-59">He appointed Jonathan’s brother Simon governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-60">Then Jonathan set out and traveled beyond the river and among the towns, and all the army of Syria gathered to him as allies. When he came to Askalon, the people of the city met him and paid him honor.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-61">From there he went to Gaza, but the people of Gaza shut him out. So he besieged it and burned its suburbs with fire and plundered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-62">Then the people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them, and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them to Jerusalem. And he passed through the country as far as Damascus.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-63">Then Jonathan heard that the officers of Demetrius had come to Kadesh in Galilee with a large army, intending to remove him from office.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-64">He went to meet them, but left his brother Simon in the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-65">Simon encamped before Beth-zur and fought against it for many days and hemmed it in.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-66">Then they asked him to grant them terms of peace, and he did so. He removed them from there, took possession of the town, and set a garrison over it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-67">Jonathan and his army encamped by the waters of Gennesaret. Early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-68">and there in the plain the army of the foreigners met him; they had set an ambush against him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-69">Then the men in ambush emerged from their places and joined battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-70">All the men with Jonathan fled; not one of them was left except Mattathias son of Absalom and Judas son of Chalphi, commanders of the forces of the army.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-71">Jonathan tore his clothes, put dust on his head, and prayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-72">Then he turned back to the battle against the enemy and routed them, and they fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-73">When his men who were fleeing saw this, they returned to him and joined him in the pursuit as far as Kadesh, to their camp, and there they encamped.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-11-74">As many as three thousand of the foreigners fell that day. And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
