He is not here, but has risen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-6">Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-7">that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-8">Then they remembered his words,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-9">and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-10">Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-11">But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-12">But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-13">Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-14">and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-15">While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-16">but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-17">And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-18">Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-19">He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-20">and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-21">But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-22">Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-23">and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-24">Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-25">Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-26">Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-27">Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-28">As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-29">But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-30">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-31">Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-32">They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-33">That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-34">They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-35">Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-36">While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-37">They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-38">He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-39">Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-41">While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-43">and he took it and ate in their presence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-44">Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-45">Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-46">and he said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-47">and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-48">You are witnesses of these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-49">And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-50">Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-51">While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-52">And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-53">and they were continually in the temple blessing God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
