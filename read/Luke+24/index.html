And they stood still, looking sad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-18">And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-21">But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-22">Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-23">and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-24">And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-25">And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-26">Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-27">And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-29">And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-30">And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking  he gave to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-32">And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-35">And they rehearsed the things  in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace  unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-43">And he took it, and ate before them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-48">Ye are witnesses of these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-50">And he led them out until  over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-24-53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
