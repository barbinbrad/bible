with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-3">Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-4">But flesh with the life thereof,  the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-5">And surely your blood,  of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-6">Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-7">And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-8">And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-9">And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-10">and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-11">And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-12">And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-13">I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-14">And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-15">and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-16">And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-17">And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-18">And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-19">These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-20">And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-21">and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-22">And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-23">And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-24">And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-25">And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-26">And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-27">God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-28">And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-9-29">And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
