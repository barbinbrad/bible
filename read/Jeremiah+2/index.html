All who ate of it were held guilty; disaster came upon them, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-4">Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-5">Thus says the Lord: What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-6">They did not say, “Where is the Lord who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-7">I brought you into a plentiful land to eat its fruits and its good things. But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-8">The priests did not say, “Where is the Lord?” Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-9">Therefore once more I accuse you, says the Lord, and I accuse your children’s children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-10">Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-11">Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-12">Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-13">for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-14">Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become plunder?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-15">The lions have roared against him, they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-16">Moreover, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-17">Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the Lord your God, while he led you in the way?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-18">What then do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-19">Your wickedness will punish you, and your apostasies will convict you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the Lord your God; the fear of me is not in you, says the Lord God of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-20">For long ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds, and you said, “I will not serve!” On every high hill and under every green tree you sprawled and played the whore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-21">Yet I planted you as a choice vine, from the purest stock. How then did you turn degenerate and become a wild vine?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-22">Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-23">How can you say, “I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals”? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done— a restive young camel interlacing her tracks,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-24">a wild ass at home in the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-25">Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, “It is hopeless, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-26">As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed— they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-27">who say to a tree, “You are my father,” and to a stone, “You gave me birth.” For they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. But in the time of their trouble they say, “Come and save us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-28">But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them come, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-29">Why do you complain against me? You have all rebelled against me, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-30">In vain I have struck down your children; they accepted no correction. Your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-31">And you, O generation, behold the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, “We are free, we will come to you no more”?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-32">Can a girl forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-33">How well you direct your course to seek lovers! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-34">Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-35">you say, “I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.” Now I am bringing you to judgment for saying, “I have not sinned.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-36">How lightly you gad about, changing your ways! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-2-37">From there also you will come away with your hands on your head; for the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper through them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
