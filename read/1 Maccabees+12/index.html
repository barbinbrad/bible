We therefore command that our envoys report to you accordingly.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-24">Now Jonathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius had returned, with a larger force than before, to wage war against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-25">So he marched away from Jerusalem and met them in the region of Hamath, for he gave them no opportunity to invade his own country.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-26">He sent spies to their camp, and they returned and reported to him that the enemy were being drawn up in formation to attack the Jews by night.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-27">So when the sun had set, Jonathan commanded his troops to be alert and to keep their arms at hand so as to be ready all night for battle, and he stationed outposts around the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-28">When the enemy heard that Jonathan and his troops were prepared for battle, they were afraid and were terrified at heart; so they kindled fires in their camp and withdrew.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-29">But Jonathan and his troops did not know it until morning, for they saw the fires burning.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-30">Then Jonathan pursued them, but he did not overtake them, for they had crossed the Eleutherus river.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-31">So Jonathan turned aside against the Arabs who are called Zabadeans, and he crushed them and plundered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-32">Then he broke camp and went to Damascus, and marched through all that region.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-33">Simon also went out and marched through the country as far as Askalon and the neighboring strongholds. He turned aside to Joppa and took it by surprise,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-34">for he had heard that they were ready to hand over the stronghold to those whom Demetrius had sent. And he stationed a garrison there to guard it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-35">When Jonathan returned he convened the elders of the people and planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-36">to build the walls of Jerusalem still higher, and to erect a high barrier between the citadel and the city to separate it from the city, in order to isolate it so that its garrison could neither buy nor sell.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-37">So they gathered together to rebuild the city; part of the wall on the valley to the east had fallen, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-38">Simon also built Adida in the Shephelah; he fortified it and installed gates with bolts.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-39">Then Trypho attempted to become king in Asia and put on the crown, and to raise his hand against King Antiochus.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-40">He feared that Jonathan might not permit him to do so, but might make war on him, so he kept seeking to seize and kill him, and he marched out and came to Beth-shan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-41">Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand picked warriors, and he came to Beth-shan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-42">When Trypho saw that he had come with a large army, he was afraid to raise his hand against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-43">So he received him with honor and commended him to all his Friends, and he gave him gifts and commanded his Friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-44">Then he said to Jonathan, “Why have you put all these people to so much trouble when we are not at war?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-45">Dismiss them now to their homes and choose for yourself a few men to stay with you, and come with me to Ptolemais. I will hand it over to you as well as the other strongholds and the remaining troops and all the officials, and will turn around and go home. For that is why I am here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-46">Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he sent away the troops, and they returned to the land of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-47">He kept with himself three thousand men, two thousand of whom he left in Galilee, while one thousand accompanied him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-48">But when Jonathan entered Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais closed the gates and seized him, and they killed with the sword all who had entered with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-49">Then Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan’s soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-50">But they realized that Jonathan had been seized and had perished along with his men, and they encouraged one another and kept marching in close formation, ready for battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-51">When their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-52">So they all reached the land of Judah safely, and they mourned for Jonathan and his companions and were in great fear; and all Israel mourned deeply.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-12-53">All the nations around them tried to destroy them, for they said, “They have no leader or helper. Now therefore let us make war on them and blot out the memory of them from humankind.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
