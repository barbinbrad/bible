the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-5">But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-6">then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-7">And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-8">If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-9">And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-10">If he take him another ; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-11">And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-12">He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-13">And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver  into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-14">And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-15">And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-16">And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-17">And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-18">And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-19">if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-20">And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-21">Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-22">And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-23">But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-24">eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-25">burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-26">And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-27">And if he smite out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-28">And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-29">But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-30">If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-31">Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-32">If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-33">And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-34">the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead  shall be his.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-35">And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-36">Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead  shall be his own.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
