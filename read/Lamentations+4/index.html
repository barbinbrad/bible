The sacred stones lie scattered at the head of every street.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-2">The precious children of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold— how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter’s hands!&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-3">Even the jackals offer the breast and nurse their young, but my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-4">The tongue of the infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives them anything.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-5">Those who feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple cling to ash heaps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-6">For the chastisement of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, though no hand was laid on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-7">Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, their hair like sapphire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-8">Now their visage is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-9">Happier were those pierced by the sword than those pierced by hunger, whose life drains away, deprived of the produce of the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-10">The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of my people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-11">The Lord gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-12">The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-13">It was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-14">Blindly they wandered through the streets, so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-15">“Away! Unclean!” people shouted at them; “Away! Away! Do not touch!” So they became fugitives and wanderers; it was said among the nations, “They shall stay here no longer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-16">The Lord himself has scattered them, he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-17">Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; we were watching eagerly for a nation that could not save.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-18">They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered; for our end had come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-19">Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-20">The Lord’s anointed, the breath of our life, was taken in their pits— the one of whom we said, “Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-21">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter Edom, you that live in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lam-4-22">The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter Zion, is accomplished, he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter Edom, he will punish, he will uncover your sins.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Lamentations+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Lamentations+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
