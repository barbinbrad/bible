We thought that their lives were madness and that their end was without honor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-5">Why have they been numbered among the children of God? And why is their lot among the saints?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-6">So it was we who strayed from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us, and the sun did not rise upon us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-7">We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction, and we journeyed through trackless deserts, but the way of the Lord we have not known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-8">What has our arrogance profited us? And what good has our boasted wealth brought us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-9">“All those things have vanished like a shadow, and like a rumor that passes by;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-10">like a ship that sails through the billowy water, and when it has passed no trace can be found, no track of its keel in the waves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-11">or as, when a bird flies through the air, no evidence of its passage is found; the light air, lashed by the beat of its pinions and pierced by the force of its rushing flight, is traversed by the movement of its wings, and afterward no sign of its coming is found there;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-12">or as, when an arrow is shot at a target, the air, thus divided, comes together at once, so that no one knows its pathway.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-13">So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be, and we had no sign of virtue to show, but were consumed in our wickedness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-14">Because the hope of the ungodly is like thistledown carried by the wind, and like a light frost driven away by a storm; it is dispersed like smoke before the wind, and it passes like the remembrance of a guest who stays but a day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-15">But the righteous live forever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-16">Therefore they will receive a glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of the Lord, because with his right hand he will cover them, and with his arm he will shield them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-17">The Lord will take his zeal as his whole armor, and will arm all creation to repel his enemies;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-18">he will put on righteousness as a breastplate, and wear impartial justice as a helmet;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-19">he will take holiness as an invincible shield,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-20">and sharpen stern wrath for a sword, and creation will join with him to fight against his frenzied foes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-21">Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim, and will leap from the clouds to the target, as from a well-drawn bow,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-22">and hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult; the water of the sea will rage against them, and rivers will relentlessly overwhelm them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-5-23">a mighty wind will rise against them, and like a tempest it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth, and evildoing will overturn the thrones of rulers.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Wisdom+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
