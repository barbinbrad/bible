he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-6">lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally;

then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-10">that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-11">But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-12">then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-13">Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-14">Thou shalt not remove thy neighborâ€™s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-15">One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-16">If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-17">then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-18">and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-19">then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-20">And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-19-21">And thine eyes shall not pity;
