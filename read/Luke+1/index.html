for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-19">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-20">And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-21">And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-22">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-23">And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-24">And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-25">Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon , to take away my reproach among men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-26">Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-27">to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-28">And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord  with thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-29">But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-30">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-31">And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-33">and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-34">And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-35">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-36">And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-37">For no word from God shall be void of power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-38">And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.

And they marvelled all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-64">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue , and he spake, blessing God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-65">And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-66">And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-67">And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-68">Blessed  the Lord, the God of Israel; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-69">And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-70">(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-71">Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-72">To show mercy towards our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-73">The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-74">To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-75">In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-76">Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-77">To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-78">Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-79">To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-80">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
