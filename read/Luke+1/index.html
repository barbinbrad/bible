His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-6">Both of them were righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-7">But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were getting on in years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-8">Once when he was serving as priest before God and his section was on duty,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-9">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and offer incense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-10">Now at the time of the incense offering, the whole assembly of the people was praying outside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-11">Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-12">When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified; and fear overwhelmed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-13">But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-14">You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-15">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink; even before his birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-16">He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-17">With the spirit and power of Elijah he will go before him, to turn the hearts of parents to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-18">Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know that this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-19">The angel replied, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-20">But now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will become mute, unable to speak, until the day these things occur.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-21">Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-22">When he did come out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-23">When his time of service was ended, he went to his home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-24">After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion. She said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-25">“This is what the Lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace I have endured among my people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-26">In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-27">to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-28">And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-29">But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-30">The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-31">And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-32">He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-33">He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-34">Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-35">The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-36">And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-37">For nothing will be impossible with God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-38">Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-39">In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-40">where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-41">When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-42">and exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-43">And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-44">For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-45">And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-46">And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-47">and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-48">for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-49">for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-50">His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-51">He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-52">He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-53">he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-54">He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-55">according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-56">And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-57">Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-60">But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-61">They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-62">Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-63">He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-64">Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-65">Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-66">All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-67">Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-68">“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-69">He has raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of his servant David,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-70">as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-71">that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-72">Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-73">the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us &nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-74">that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear, &nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-75">in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-76">And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-77">to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-78">By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-79">to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-1-80">The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
