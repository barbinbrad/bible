but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-6">They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-7">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-8">But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-9">And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-10">And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold two men stood by them in white apparel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-11">who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-12">Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath dayâ€™s journey off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-13">And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James  of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas  of James.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-14">These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-15">And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons  together, about a hundred and twenty),&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-16">Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-17">For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-18">(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-19">And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-21">Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-22">beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-23">And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-24">And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-25">to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-26">And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
