Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-2">The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-3">Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-4">Did you experience so much for nothing?—if it really was for nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-5">Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-6">Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-7">so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the Gentiles shall be blessed in you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-9">For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-10">For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-11">Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-12">But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the works of the law will live by them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-14">in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-15">Brothers and sisters, I give an example from daily life: once a person’s will has been ratified, no one adds to it or annuls it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-16">Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring; it does not say, “And to offsprings,” as of many; but it says, “And to your offspring,” that is, to one person, who is Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-17">My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-18">For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-19">Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-20">Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-21">Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-22">But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-23">Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-24">Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-26">for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-27">As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-28">There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to the promise.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Galatians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
