And you do many things like this.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-14">Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-15">there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-16">When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-17">He said to them, “Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-18">since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-19">And he said, “It is what comes out of a person that defiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-20">For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-21">adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-22">All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-23">From there he set out and went away to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-24">but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-25">Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-26">He said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-27">But she answered him, “Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-28">Then he said to her, “For saying that, you may go—the demon has left your daughter.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-29">So she went home, found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-30">Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-31">They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-32">He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-33">Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-34">And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-35">Then Jesus ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-36">They were astounded beyond measure, saying, “He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
