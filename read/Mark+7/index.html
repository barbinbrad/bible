Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man,  cannot defile him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-18">because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? , making all meats clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-19">And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-20">For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-21">covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-22">all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-23">And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-24">But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-25">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-26">And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-27">But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-28">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-29">And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-30">And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-31">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-32">And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-33">and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-34">And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-35">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-7-36">And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
