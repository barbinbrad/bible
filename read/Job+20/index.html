And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-4">Knowest thou  this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-5">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-6">Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-7">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-10">His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-11">His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-13">Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-14">Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-16">He shall suck the poison of asps: The viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-17">He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-18">That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-19">For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-20">Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-21">There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-23">When he is about to fill his belly,  will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-24">He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-25">He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown  shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-28">The increase of his house shall depart;  shall flow away in the day of his wrath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
