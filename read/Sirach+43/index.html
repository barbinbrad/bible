At his will the south wind blows; so do the storm from the north and the whirlwind. He scatters the snow like birds flying down, and its descent is like locusts alighting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-17">The eye is dazzled by the beauty of its whiteness, and the mind is amazed as it falls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-18">He pours frost over the earth like salt, and icicles form like pointed thorns.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-19">The cold north wind blows, and ice freezes on the water; it settles on every pool of water, and the water puts it on like a breastplate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-20">He consumes the mountains and burns up the wilderness, and withers the tender grass like fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-21">A mist quickly heals all things; the falling dew gives refreshment from the heat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-22">By his plan he stilled the deep and planted islands in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-23">Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers, and we marvel at what we hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-24">In it are strange and marvelous creatures, all kinds of living things, and huge sea-monsters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-25">Because of him each of his messengers succeeds, and by his word all things hold together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-26">We could say more but could never say enough; let the final word be: “He is the all.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-43-27">Where can we find the strength to praise him?
