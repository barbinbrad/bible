He delivers up nations to him, and tramples kings under foot; he makes them like dust with his sword, like driven stubble with his bow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-3">He pursues them and passes on safely, scarcely touching the path with his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-4">Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord, am first, and will be with the last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-5">The coastlands have seen and are afraid, the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-6">Each one helps the other, saying to one another, “Take courage!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-7">The artisan encourages the goldsmith, and the one who smooths with the hammer encourages the one who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, “It is good”; and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-8">But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-9">you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, “You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-10">do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-11">Yes, all who are incensed against you shall be ashamed and disgraced; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-12">You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-13">For I, the Lord your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, “Do not fear, I will help you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-14">Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-15">Now, I will make of you a threshing sledge, sharp, new, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-16">You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. Then you shall rejoice in the Lord; in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-17">When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-18">I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-19">I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive; I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane and the pine together,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-20">so that all may see and know, all may consider and understand, that the hand of the Lord has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-21">Set forth your case, says the Lord; bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-22">Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former things, what they are, so that we may consider them, and that we may know their outcome; or declare to us the things to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-23">Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be afraid and terrified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-24">You, indeed, are nothing and your work is nothing at all; whoever chooses you is an abomination.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-25">I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun he was summoned by name. He shall trample on rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-26">Who declared it from the beginning, so that we might know, and beforehand, so that we might say, “He is right”? There was no one who declared it, none who proclaimed, none who heard your words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-27">I first have declared it to Zion, and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good tidings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-28">But when I look there is no one; among these there is no counselor who, when I ask, gives an answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-41-29">No, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their images are empty wind.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+40/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+42/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
