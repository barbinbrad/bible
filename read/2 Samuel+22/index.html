My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-4">I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-5">For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-6">The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-7">In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry  into his ears.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-8">Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-11">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-12">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-13">At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-14">Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-15">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-16">Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-17">He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-19">They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-20">He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-21">Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-22">For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-23">For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-24">I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-25">Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-26">With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-27">With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-28">And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-29">For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-30">For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-31">As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-32">For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-33">God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-34">He maketh his feet like hindsâ€™ , And setteth me upon my high places.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-35">He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-36">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-37">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-38">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-39">And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-40">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-41">Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-42">They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-43">Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-44">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-45">The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-46">The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-47">Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-48">Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-49">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-50">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-22-51">Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
