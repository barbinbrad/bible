The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-2">Surely I am more brutish than any man, And have not the understanding of a man;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-3">And I have not learned wisdom, Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-4">Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in his garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-5">Every word of God is tried: He is a shield unto them that take refuge in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-6">Add thou not unto his words, Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-7">Two things have I asked of thee; Deny me  not before I die:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-8">Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-9">Lest I be full, and deny , and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor, and steal, And use profanely the name of my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-10">Slander not a servant unto his master, Lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-11">There is a generation that curse their father, And bless not their mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-12">There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, And  are not washed from their filthiness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-13">There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-14">There is a generation whose teeth are  swords, and their jaw teeth  knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-15">The horseleach hath two daughters, , Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, , four that say not, Enough:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-16">Sheol; and the barren womb; The earth that is not satisfied with water; And the fire that saith not, Enough.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-17">The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out, And the young eagles shall eat it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-18">There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yea, four which I know not:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-19">The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent upon a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a man with a maiden.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-20">So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, And saith, I have done no wickedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-21">For three things the earth doth tremble, And for four,  it cannot bear:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-22">For a servant when he is king; And a fool when he is filled with food;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-23">For an odious woman when she is married; And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-24">There are four things which are little upon the earth, But they are exceeding wise:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-25">The ants are a people not strong, Yet they provide their food in the summer;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-26">The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-27">The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-28">The lizard taketh hold with her hands, Yet is she in kings’ palaces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-29">There are three things which are stately in their march, Yea, four which are stately in going:&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-30">The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And turneth not away for any;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-31">The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-32">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, Or if thou hast thought evil,  thy hand upon thy mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-30-33">For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood; So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Proverbs+29/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Proverbs+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
