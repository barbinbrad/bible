Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-10">When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, “Who is this?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-11">The crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-12">Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-13">He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-14">The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-15">But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did, and heard the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became angry&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-16">and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-17">He left them, went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-18">In the morning, when he returned to the city, he was hungry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-19">And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road, he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-20">When the disciples saw it, they were amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-21">Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-22">Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-23">When he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-24">Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-25">Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-26">But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we are afraid of the crowd; for all regard John as a prophet.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-27">So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-28">“What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-29">He answered, ‘I will not’; but later he changed his mind and went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-30">The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir’; but he did not go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-31">Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-33">“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-34">When the harvest time had come, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-35">But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-36">Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-37">Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-39">So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-40">Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-41">They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-42">Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord’s doing, and it is amazing in our eyes’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-43">Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-44">The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-45">When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-46">They wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowds, because they regarded him as a prophet.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
