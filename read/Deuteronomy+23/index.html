Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants shall be admitted to the assembly of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-3">No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted to the assembly of the Lord. Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants shall be admitted to the assembly of the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-4">because they did not meet you with food and water on your journey out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam son of Beor, from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-5">(Yet the Lord your God refused to heed Balaam; the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loved you.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-6">You shall never promote their welfare or their prosperity as long as you live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-7">You shall not abhor any of the Edomites, for they are your kin. You shall not abhor any of the Egyptians, because you were an alien residing in their land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-8">The children of the third generation that are born to them may be admitted to the assembly of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-9">When you are encamped against your enemies you shall guard against any impropriety.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-10">If one of you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, then he shall go outside the camp; he must not come within the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-11">When evening comes, he shall wash himself with water, and when the sun has set, he may come back into the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-12">You shall have a designated area outside the camp to which you shall go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-13">With your utensils you shall have a trowel; when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig a hole with it and then cover up your excrement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-14">Because the Lord your God travels along with your camp, to save you and to hand over your enemies to you, therefore your camp must be holy, so that he may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-15">Slaves who have escaped to you from their owners shall not be given back to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-16">They shall reside with you, in your midst, in any place they choose in any one of your towns, wherever they please; you shall not oppress them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-17">None of the daughters of Israel shall be a temple prostitute; none of the sons of Israel shall be a temple prostitute.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-18">You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the wages of a male prostitute into the house of the Lord your God in payment for any vow, for both of these are abhorrent to the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-19">You shall not charge interest on loans to another Israelite, interest on money, interest on provisions, interest on anything that is lent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-20">On loans to a foreigner you may charge interest, but on loans to another Israelite you may not charge interest, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your undertakings in the land that you are about to enter and possess.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-23-21">If you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not postpone fulfilling it;
