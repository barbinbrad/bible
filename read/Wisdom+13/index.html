and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know the one who exists, nor did they recognize the artisan while paying heed to his works;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-2">but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air, or the circle of the stars, or turbulent water, or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-3">If through delight in the beauty of these things people assumed them to be gods, let them know how much better than these is their Lord, for the author of beauty created them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-4">And if people were amazed at their power and working, let them perceive from them how much more powerful is the one who formed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-5">For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-6">Yet these people are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-7">For while they live among his works, they keep searching, and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-8">Yet again, not even they are to be excused;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-9">for if they had the power to know so much that they could investigate the world, how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-10">But miserable, with their hopes set on dead things, are those who give the name “gods” to the works of human hands, gold and silver fashioned with skill, and likenesses of animals, or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-11">A skilled woodcutter may saw down a tree easy to handle and skillfully strip off all its bark, and then with pleasing workmanship make a useful vessel that serves life’s needs,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-12">and burn the cast-off pieces of his work to prepare his food, and eat his fill.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-13">But a cast-off piece from among them, useful for nothing, a stick crooked and full of knots, he takes and carves with care in his leisure, and shapes it with skill gained in idleness; he forms it in the likeness of a human being,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-14">or makes it like some worthless animal, giving it a coat of red paint and coloring its surface red and covering every blemish in it with paint;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-15">then he makes a suitable niche for it, and sets it in the wall, and fastens it there with iron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-16">He takes thought for it, so that it may not fall, because he knows that it cannot help itself, for it is only an image and has need of help.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-17">When he prays about possessions and his marriage and children, he is not ashamed to address a lifeless thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-18">For health he appeals to a thing that is weak; for life he prays to a thing that is dead; for aid he entreats a thing that is utterly inexperienced; for a prosperous journey, a thing that cannot take a step;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-13-19">for money-making and work and success with his hands he asks strength of a thing whose hands have no strength.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Wisdom+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
