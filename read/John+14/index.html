Believe in God, believe also in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-2">In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-4">And you know the way to the place where I am going.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-5">Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-6">Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-7">If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-8">Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-9">Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-10">Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-11">Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-12">Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-13">I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-14">If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-15">“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-16">And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-17">This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-18">“I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-19">In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-20">On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-21">They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-22">Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-23">Jesus answered him, “Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-24">Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is not mine, but is from the Father who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-25">“I have said these things to you while I am still with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-26">But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-27">Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-28">You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-29">And now I have told you this before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you may believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-30">I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-14-31">but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us be on our way.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
