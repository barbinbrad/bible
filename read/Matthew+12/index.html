And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-11">And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-12">How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-13">Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-14">But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-15">And Jesus perceiving  withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-16">and charged them that they should not make him known:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-17">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-18">Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-19">He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-20">A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-21">And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-22">Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-23">And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-24">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-25">And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-26">and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-27">And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-28">But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-29">Or how can one enter into the house of the strong , and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong ? and then he will spoil his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-30">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-31">Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-32">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-33">Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-34">Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-35">The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-36">And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-37">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-38">Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-39">But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-40">for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-41">The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-42">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-43">But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-44">Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-45">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-46">While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-47">And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-48">But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-49">And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-50">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
