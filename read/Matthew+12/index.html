So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-13">Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-14">But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-15">When Jesus became aware of this, he departed. Many crowds followed him, and he cured all of them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-16">and he ordered them not to make him known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-17">This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-18">“Here is my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-19">He will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-20">He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-21">And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-22">Then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute; and he cured him, so that the one who had been mute could speak and see.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-23">All the crowds were amazed and said, “Can this be the Son of David?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-24">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that this fellow casts out the demons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-25">He knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-26">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-27">If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-28">But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-29">Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property, without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-30">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-31">Therefore I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-32">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-33">“Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-34">You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-35">The good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-36">I tell you, on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-37">for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-38">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-39">But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-40">For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-41">The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and see, something greater than Jonah is here!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-42">The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-43">“When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place, but it finds none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-44">Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ When it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-45">Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-46">While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-47">Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-48">But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-49">And pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-12-50">For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
