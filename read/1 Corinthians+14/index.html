I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-16">Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-17">For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-18">I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-19">howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-20">Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-21">In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-22">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying , not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-23">If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-25">the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-26">What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-27">If any man speaketh in a tongue,  by two, or at the most three, and  in turn; and let one interpret:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-28">but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-29">And let the prophets speak  two or three, and let the others discern.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-30">But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-31">For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-32">and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-33">for God is not  of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, &nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-34">let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-35">And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-36">What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-37">If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-38">But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-39">Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-40">But let all things be done decently and in order.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
