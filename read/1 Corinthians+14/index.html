One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-6">Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-7">It is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as the flute or the harp. If they do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is being played?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-8">And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-9">So with yourselves; if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-10">There are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world, and nothing is without sound.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-11">If then I do not know the meaning of a sound, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-12">So with yourselves; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in them for building up the church.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-13">Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-15">What should I do then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the mind also; I will sing praise with the spirit, but I will sing praise with the mind also.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-16">Otherwise, if you say a blessing with the spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since the outsider does not know what you are saying?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-17">For you may give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-19">nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-20">Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; rather, be infants in evil, but in thinking be adults.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-21">In the law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people; yet even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord. &nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-22">Tongues, then, are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-23">If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your mind?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-24">But if all prophesy, an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-25">After the secrets of the unbeliever’s heart are disclosed, that person will bow down before God and worship him, declaring, “God is really among you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-26">What should be done then, my friends? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-28">But if there is no one to interpret, let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-29">Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-30">If a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby, let the first person be silent.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-31">For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-32">And the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-33">for God is a God not of disorder but of peace. (As in all the churches of the saints, &nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-34">women should be silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the law also says.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-35">If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-36">Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?)&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-37">Anyone who claims to be a prophet, or to have spiritual powers, must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-38">Anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-39">So, my friends, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-14-40">but all things should be done decently and in order.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
