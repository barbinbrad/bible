And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-4">And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-5">but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-6">And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-7">And  he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-8">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-9">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-10">And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-11">And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-12">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-13">Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-14">And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-15">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-16">Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-17">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-18">And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more .&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-19">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-20">and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, , Because I have asked him of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-21">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-22">But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband,  until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-23">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-24">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-25">And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-26">And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-27">For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-1-28">therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ruth+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
