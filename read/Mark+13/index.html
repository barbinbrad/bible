Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-3">When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-4">“Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-5">Then Jesus began to say to them, “Beware that no one leads you astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-6">Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-8">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-9">“As for yourselves, beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-10">And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-11">When they bring you to trial and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-12">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-13">and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-14">“But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-15">the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-16">the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-17">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-18">Pray that it may not be in winter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-19">For in those days there will be suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, no, and never will be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-20">And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut short those days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-21">And if anyone says to you at that time, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘Look! There he is!’—do not believe it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-22">False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-23">But be alert; I have already told you everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-24">“But in those days, after that suffering, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-25">and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-26">Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-27">Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-28">“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-29">So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-30">Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-32">“But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-33">Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-34">It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-35">Therefore, keep awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-36">or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-13-37">And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
