Any case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-18">So I charged you at that time with all the things that you should do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-19">Then, just as the Lord our God had ordered us, we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, until we reached Kadesh-barnea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-20">I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-21">See, the Lord your God has given the land to you; go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you; do not fear or be dismayed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-22">All of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-23">The plan seemed good to me, and I selected twelve of you, one from each tribe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-24">They set out and went up into the hill country, and when they reached the Valley of Eshcol they spied it out&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-25">and gathered some of the land’s produce, which they brought down to us. They brought back a report to us, and said, “It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-26">But you were unwilling to go up. You rebelled against the command of the Lord your God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-27">you grumbled in your tents and said, “It is because the Lord hates us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to destroy us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-28">Where are we headed? Our kindred have made our hearts melt by reporting, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified up to heaven! We actually saw there the offspring of the Anakim!’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-29">I said to you, “Have no dread or fear of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-30">The Lord your God, who goes before you, is the one who will fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-31">and in the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, just as one carries a child, all the way that you traveled until you reached this place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-32">But in spite of this, you have no trust in the Lord your God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-33">who goes before you on the way to seek out a place for you to camp, in fire by night, and in the cloud by day, to show you the route you should take.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-34">When the Lord heard your words, he was wrathful and swore:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-35">“Not one of these—not one of this evil generation—shall see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-36">except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his descendants I will give the land on which he set foot, because of his complete fidelity to the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-37">Even with me the Lord was angry on your account, saying, “You also shall not enter there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-38">Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, shall enter there; encourage him, for he is the one who will secure Israel’s possession of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-39">And as for your little ones, who you thought would become booty, your children, who today do not yet know right from wrong, they shall enter there; to them I will give it, and they shall take possession of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-40">But as for you, journey back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-41">You answered me, “We have sinned against the Lord! We are ready to go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.” So all of you strapped on your battle gear, and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-42">The Lord said to me, “Say to them, ‘Do not go up and do not fight, for I am not in the midst of you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-43">Although I told you, you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-44">The Amorites who lived in that hill country then came out against you and chased you as bees do. They beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-45">When you returned and wept before the Lord, the Lord would neither heed your voice nor pay you any attention.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-1-46">After you had stayed at Kadesh as many days as you did,&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+36/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
