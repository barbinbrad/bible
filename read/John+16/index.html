And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-5">But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-6">But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-7">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-8">And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-9">of sin, because they believe not on me;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-10">of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-11">of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-12">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-13">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear,  shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-14">He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare  unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-15">All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare  unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-16">A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-17">of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-18">They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-19">Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-20">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-21">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-22">And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-23">And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-24">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-25">These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-26">In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-27">for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-28">I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-29">His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-30">Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-31">Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-32">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and  I am not alone, because the Father is with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-33">These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
