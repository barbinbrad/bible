And he sent them away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-10">And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-11">The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, asking him for a sign from heaven, to test him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-13">And he left them, and getting into the boat again, he went across to the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-14">Now the disciples had forgotten to bring any bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-15">And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out—beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-16">They said to one another, “It is because we have no bread.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-17">And becoming aware of it, Jesus said to them, “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-18">Do you have eyes, and fail to see? Do you have ears, and fail to hear? And do you not remember?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?” They said to him, “Twelve.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-20">“And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?” And they said to him, “Seven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-21">Then he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-22">They came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-23">He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, “Can you see anything?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-24">And the man looked up and said, “I can see people, but they look like trees, walking.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-25">Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he looked intently and his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-26">Then he sent him away to his home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-27">Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-28">And they answered him, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-29">He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-30">And he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-31">Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-32">He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-33">But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-34">He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-35">For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-36">For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-37">Indeed, what can they give in return for their life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-38">Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
