Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a helper to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-3">Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a long robe with sleeves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-4">But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-5">Once Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-6">He said to them, “Listen to this dream that I dreamed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-7">There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright; then your sheaves gathered around it, and bowed down to my sheaf.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-8">His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Are you indeed to have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more because of his dreams and his words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-9">He had another dream, and told it to his brothers, saying, “Look, I have had another dream: the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-10">But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What kind of dream is this that you have had? Shall we indeed come, I and your mother and your brothers, and bow to the ground before you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-11">So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-12">Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-13">And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” He answered, “Here I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-14">So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock; and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron. He came to Shechem, &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-15">and a man found him wandering in the fields; the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-16">“I am seeking my brothers,” he said; “tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-17">The man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-18">They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they conspired to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-19">They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-20">Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild animal has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-21">But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-22">Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand and restore him to his father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-23">So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-24">and they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-25">Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balm, and resin, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-26">Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-27">Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers agreed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-28">When some Midianite traders passed by, they drew Joseph up, lifting him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-29">When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-30">He returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy is gone; and I, where can I turn?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-31">Then they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-32">They had the long robe with sleeves taken to their father, and they said, “This we have found; see now whether it is your son’s robe or not.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-33">He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s robe! A wild animal has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-34">Then Jacob tore his garments, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-35">All his sons and all his daughters sought to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, “No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father bewailed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-37-36">Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+36/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+38/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
