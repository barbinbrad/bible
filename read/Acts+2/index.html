and it sat upon each one of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-6">And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-7">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-8">And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-9">Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-10">in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-11">Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-12">And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-13">But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, , Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-15">For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is  the third hour of the day;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-16">but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-17">And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-18">Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-19">And I will show wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come, That great and notable :&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-21">And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-22">Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-23">him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-24">whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-25">For David saith concerning him, I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-26">Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-27">Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades, Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-28">Thou madest known unto me the ways of life; Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-29">Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-30">Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set  upon his throne;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-31">he foreseeing  spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-32">This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-33">Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-34">For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-35">Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-36">Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-37">Now when they heard , they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-38">And Peter  unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-39">For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off,  as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-40">And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-41">They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added  in that day about three thousand souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-42">And they continued stedfastly in the apostlesâ€™ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-44">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-45">and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-46">And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-47">praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
