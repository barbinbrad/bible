The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-3">And utter an allegory to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Set on the pot, set it on, pour in water also;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-4">put in it the pieces, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-5">Take the choicest one of the flock, pile the logs under it; boil its pieces, seethe also its bones in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-6">Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, the pot whose rust is in it, whose rust has not gone out of it! Empty it piece by piece, making no choice at all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-7">For the blood she shed is inside it; she placed it on a bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground, to cover it with earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-8">To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have placed the blood she shed on a bare rock, so that it may not be covered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-9">Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile great.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-10">Heap up the logs, kindle the fire; boil the meat well, mix in the spices, let the bones be burned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-11">Stand it empty upon the coals, so that it may become hot, its copper glow, its filth melt in it, its rust be consumed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-12">In vain I have wearied myself; its thick rust does not depart. To the fire with its rust!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-13">Yet, when I cleansed you in your filthy lewdness, you did not become clean from your filth; you shall not again be cleansed until I have satisfied my fury upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-14">I the Lord have spoken; the time is coming, I will act. I will not refrain, I will not spare, I will not relent. According to your ways and your doings I will judge you, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-15">The word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-16">Mortal, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-17">Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-18">So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-19">Then the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting this way?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-20">Then I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-21">Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and your heart’s desire; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-22">And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-23">Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-24">Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; you shall do just as he has done. When this comes, then you shall know that I am the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-25">And you, mortal, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their heart’s affection, and also their sons and their daughters,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-26">on that day, one who has escaped will come to you to report to you the news.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-24-27">On that day your mouth shall be opened to the one who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be silent. So you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
