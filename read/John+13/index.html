He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-7">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-8">Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-9">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-10">Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-11">For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-12">So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-13">Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-14">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-15">For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-16">Verily, verily, I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-17">If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-18">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-19">From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am .&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-20">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-21">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-22">The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-23">There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-24">Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell  who it is of whom he speaketh.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-25">He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-26">Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas,  of Simon Iscariot.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-27">And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-28">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-29">For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-30">He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-31">When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-32">and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-34">A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-35">By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-36">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-37">Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-38">Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
