Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-2">The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-3">Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-4">got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-6">He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-7">Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-8">Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-9">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-10">Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-11">For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-12">After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-13">You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-14">So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-15">For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-16">Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-17">If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-18">I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is to fulfill the scripture, ‘The one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-19">I tell you this now, before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am he.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-20">Very truly, I tell you, whoever receives one whom I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-21">After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, “Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-22">The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-23">One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining next to him;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-24">Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-25">So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-26">Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.” So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-27">After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “Do quickly what you are going to do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-28">Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-29">Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the festival”; or, that he should give something to the poor.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-30">So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-31">When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-32">If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-33">Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-34">I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-35">By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-36">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterward.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-37">Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-13-38">Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Very truly, I tell you, before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
