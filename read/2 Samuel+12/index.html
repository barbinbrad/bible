And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-2">The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-3">but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-4">And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-5">And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-6">and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-7">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-8">and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-9">Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-10">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-11">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-12">For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-13">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-14">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-15">And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-16">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-17">And the elders of his house arose,  beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-18">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-19">But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-20">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-21">Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-22">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-23">But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-24">And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-25">and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-26">Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-27">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-28">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-29">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-30">And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and  precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-12-31">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
