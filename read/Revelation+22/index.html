On either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-3">Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-4">they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-5">And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-6">And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-7">“See, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-9">but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-10">And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-11">Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-12">“See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone’s work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-13">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-14">Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-15">Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-16">“It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-17">The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” And let everyone who hears say, “Come.” And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-18">I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-19">if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-20">The one who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-22-21">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Revelation+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
