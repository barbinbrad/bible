Or what is the value of circumcision?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-2">Much, in every way. For in the first place the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-3">What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-4">By no means! Although everyone is a liar, let God be proved true, as it is written, “So that you may be justified in your words, and prevail in your judging.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-5">But if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of God, what should we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-6">By no means! For then how could God judge the world?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-7">But if through my falsehood God’s truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-8">And why not say (as some people slander us by saying that we say), “Let us do evil so that good may come”? Their condemnation is deserved!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-9">What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all; for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-10">as it is written: “There is no one who is righteous, not even one;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-11">there is no one who has understanding, there is no one who seeks God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-12">All have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, there is not even one.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-13">“Their throats are opened graves; they use their tongues to deceive.” “The venom of vipers is under their lips.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-14">“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-15">“Their feet are swift to shed blood;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-16">ruin and misery are in their paths,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-17">and the way of peace they have not known.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-18">“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-20">For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-21">But now, apart from law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed, and is attested by the law and the prophets,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-22">the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-23">since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-24">they are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-25">whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood, effective through faith. He did this to show his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-26">it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-27">Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works? No, but by the law of faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-28">For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-29">Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-30">since God is one; and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-31">Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
