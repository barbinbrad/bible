Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-7">But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-8">and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-10">as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-11">There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-12">They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-15">Their feet are swift to shed blood;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-16">Destruction and misery are in their ways;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-17">And the way of peace have they not known:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-20">because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law  the knowledge of sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-21">But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-22">even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-23">for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-24">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-25">whom God set forth  a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-26">for the showing, , of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-27">Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-28">We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-29">Or is God  of Jews only? is he not  of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-30">if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-3-31">Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
