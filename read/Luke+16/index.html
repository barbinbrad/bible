Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-3">Then the manager said to himself, ‘What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-4">I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-5">So, summoning his master’s debtors one by one, he asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-6">He answered, ‘A hundred jugs of olive oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-7">Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘A hundred containers of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and make it eighty.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-8">And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-9">And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-10">“Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-11">If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-12">And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-13">No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-14">The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they ridiculed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-15">So he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-16">“The law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone tries to enter it by force.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-18">“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-19">“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-20">And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-21">who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man’s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-22">The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-23">In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-24">He called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-25">But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-26">Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-27">He said, ‘Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father’s house—&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-28">for I have five brothers—that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-29">Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-30">He said, ‘No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-31">He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
