I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-4">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-5">And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-6">And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-7">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-8">And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-9">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-10">He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-11">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true ?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-12">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-13">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-14">And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-15">And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-16">The law and the prophets  until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-18">Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-19">Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-20">and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-21">and desiring to be fed with the  that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-23">And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-24">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-26">And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-27">And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-28">for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-29">But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-30">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-16-31">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
