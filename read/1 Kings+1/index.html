And the king said, What wouldest thou?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-17">And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-18">And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-19">and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-20">And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-21">Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-22">And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-23">And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-24">And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-25">For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,  live king Adonijah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-26">But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-27">Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-28">Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-29">And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-30">verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-31">Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-32">And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-33">And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-34">and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say,  live king Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-35">Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-36">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so .&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-37">As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-38">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-39">And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said,  live king Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-40">And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-41">And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-42">While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-43">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-44">and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-45">and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-46">And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-47">And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-48">And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-49">And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-50">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-51">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-52">And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-53">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Kings+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
