But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-4">In the same way, my friends, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-5">While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-6">But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-7">What then should we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-8">But sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-9">I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-10">and I died, and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-11">For sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-12">So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-13">Did what is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-14">For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am of the flesh, sold into slavery under sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-15">I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-16">Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-17">But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-18">For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-19">For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-20">Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-21">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-22">For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-23">but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-24">Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-25">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I am a slave to the law of God, but with my flesh I am a slave to the law of sin.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
