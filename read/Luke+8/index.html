The twelve were with him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-2">as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-3">and Joanna, the wife of Herod’s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-4">When a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-5">“A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell on the path and was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-6">Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered for lack of moisture.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-7">Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-8">Some fell into good soil, and when it grew, it produced a hundredfold.” As he said this, he called out, “Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-9">Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-10">He said, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in parables, so that ‘looking they may not perceive, and listening they may not understand.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-11">“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-12">The ones on the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-13">The ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-14">As for what fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-15">But as for that in the good soil, these are the ones who, when they hear the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-16">“No one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar, or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-17">For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed, nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-18">Then pay attention to how you listen; for to those who have, more will be given; and from those who do not have, even what they seem to have will be taken away.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-19">Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-20">And he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-21">But he said to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-22">One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they put out,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-23">and while they were sailing he fell asleep. A windstorm swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-24">They went to him and woke him up, shouting, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased, and there was a calm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-25">He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were afraid and amazed, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-26">Then they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-27">As he stepped out on land, a man of the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but in the tombs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-28">When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me”—&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-29">for Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-30">Jesus then asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion”; for many demons had entered him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-31">They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-32">Now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter these. So he gave them permission.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-33">Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-34">When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-35">Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-36">Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-37">Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-38">The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-39">“Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-40">Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-41">Just then there came a man named Jairus, a leader of the synagogue. He fell at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come to his house,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-42">for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As he went, the crowds pressed in on him. &nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-43">Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years; and though she had spent all she had on physicians, no one could cure her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-44">She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-45">Then Jesus asked, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds surround you and press in on you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-46">But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-47">When the woman saw that she could not remain hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him, she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-48">He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-49">While he was still speaking, someone came from the leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-50">When Jesus heard this, he replied, “Do not fear. Only believe, and she will be saved.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-51">When he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-52">They were all weeping and wailing for her; but he said, “Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-53">And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-54">But he took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-55">Her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he directed them to give her something to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-56">Her parents were astounded; but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
