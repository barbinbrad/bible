If another disciple sins, you must rebuke the offender, and if there is repentance, you must forgive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-4">And if the same person sins against you seven times a day, and turns back to you seven times and says, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-5">The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-6">The Lord replied, “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-7">“Who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, ‘Come here at once and take your place at the table’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-8">Would you not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-9">Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-10">So you also, when you have done all that you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-11">On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-12">As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-13">they called out, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-14">When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were made clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-15">Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-16">He prostrated himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-17">Then Jesus asked, “Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-18">Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-19">Then he said to him, “Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-20">Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, and he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-21">nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-22">Then he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-23">They will say to you, ‘Look there!’ or ‘Look here!’ Do not go, do not set off in pursuit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-24">For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-25">But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-26">Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-27">They were eating and drinking, and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-28">Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-29">but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-30">—it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-31">On that day, anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-32">Remember Lot’s wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-33">Those who try to make their life secure will lose it, but those who lose their life will keep it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-34">I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-35">There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-36">Then they asked him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
