I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-17">Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-18">And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live in your sight!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-19">God said, “No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac.
