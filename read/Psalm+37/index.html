Dwell in the land, and feed on  faithfulness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-4">Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-5">Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-6">And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noon-day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-7">Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-8">Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself,  only to evil-doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-9">For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-10">For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-11">But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-12">The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-13">The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-14">The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-15">Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-16">Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-17">For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-18">Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-19">They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-20">But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-21">The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-22">For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-23">A manâ€™s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-24">Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-25">I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-26">All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-27">Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-28">For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-29">The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-30">The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-31">The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-32">The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-33">Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-34">Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-35">I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-36">But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-37">Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a  end to the man of peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-38">As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: The end of the wicked shall be cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-39">But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-37-40">And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them: He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+36/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+38/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
