Ye did me no wrong:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-13">but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-14">and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God,  as Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-15">Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-16">So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-17">They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-18">But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-19">My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in youâ€”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-20">but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-23">Howbeit the  by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the  by the freewoman  through promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-24">Which things contain an allegory: for these  are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-25">Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him  after the Spirit, so also it is now.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-30">Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-31">Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Galatians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
