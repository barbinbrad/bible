because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-14">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-15">Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-16">Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-17">And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-18">Ye blind: for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-19">He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-20">And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-21">And he that sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-22">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-23">Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-24">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-25">Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-26">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-27">Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-28">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-29">and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-30">Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-31">Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-32">Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-33">Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-34">that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-35">Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-36">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-37">Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-38">For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed  he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
