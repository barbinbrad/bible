For you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. For you do not go in yourselves, and when others are going in, you stop them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-14">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cross sea and land to make a single convert, and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-15">“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-16">You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-17">And you say, ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-18">How blind you are! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-19">So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-20">and whoever swears by the sanctuary, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-21">and whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-22">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-23">You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-24">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-25">You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside also may become clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-26">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside look beautiful, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-27">So you also on the outside look righteous to others, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-28">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-29">and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-30">Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-31">Fill up, then, the measure of your ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-32">You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-33">Therefore I send you prophets, sages, and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-34">so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-35">Truly I tell you, all this will come upon this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-36">“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-37">See, your house is left to you, desolate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-23-38">For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
