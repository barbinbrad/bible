To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, and for you it is a safeguard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-3">For it is we who are the circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the fleshâ€”&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-4">even though I, too, have reason for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: &nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-5">circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-6">as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-7">Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-8">More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-9">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-10">I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-11">if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-12">Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-13">Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-14">I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-15">Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-16">Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-17">Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-18">For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-19">Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-20">But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-3-21">He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Philippians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Philippians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
