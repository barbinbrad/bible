Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-16">I will therefore have him flogged and release him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-17">Then they all shouted out together, “Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-18">(This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-19">Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-20">but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-21">A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-22">But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-23">So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-24">He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-25">As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-26">A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-27">But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-28">For the days are surely coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-29">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-30">For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-31">Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-32">When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-33">[[Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.”]] And they cast lots to divide his clothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-34">And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-35">The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-36">and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-37">There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-38">One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, “Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-39">But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-40">And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-41">Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-42">He replied, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-43">It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-44">while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-45">Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” Having said this, he breathed his last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-46">When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “Certainly this man was innocent.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-47">And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-48">But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-49">Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-50">had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-51">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-52">Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-53">It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-54">The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-55">Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
