I hereby give the land into his hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-3">Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-4">Then Judah went up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-5">They came upon Adoni-bezek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-6">Adoni-bezek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-7">Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has paid me back.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-8">Then the people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-9">Afterward the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-10">Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-11">From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher).&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-12">Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as wife.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-13">And Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-14">When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-15">She said to him, “Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also Gulloth-mayim.” So Caleb gave her Upper Gulloth and Lower Gulloth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-16">The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad. Then they went and settled with the Amalekites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-17">Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and devoted it to destruction. So the city was called Hormah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-18">Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-19">The Lord was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-20">Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-21">But the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived in Jerusalem among the Benjaminites to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-22">The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and the Lord was with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-23">The house of Joseph sent out spies to Bethel (the name of the city was formerly Luz).&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-24">When the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-25">So he showed them the way into the city; and they put the city to the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-26">So the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and named it Luz; that is its name to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-27">Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; but the Canaanites continued to live in that land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-28">When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not in fact drive them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-29">And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-30">Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-31">Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob;&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-32">but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-33">Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-34">The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country; they did not allow them to come down to the plain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-35">The Amorites continued to live in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-1-36">The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judges+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
