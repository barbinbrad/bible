With all wisdom and insight&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-9">he has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-10">as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-11">In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-12">so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-13">In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-14">this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as Godâ€™s own people, to the praise of his glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-15">I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-16">I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-17">I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-18">so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-19">and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-20">God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-21">far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-22">And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-23">which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev"
