through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-3">Blessed the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly  in Christ:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-4">even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-5">having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-6">to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-7">in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-8">which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-9">making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-10">unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-11">in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-12">to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-13">in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,â€”in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-14">which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of  own possession, unto the praise of his glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-15">For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which  toward all the saints,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-16">cease not to give thanks for you, making mention  in my prayers;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-18">having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-19">and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-20">which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-21">far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-22">and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-1-23">which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Galatians+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0
