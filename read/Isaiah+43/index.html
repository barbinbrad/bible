I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-4">Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you, I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-5">Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-6">I will say to the north, “Give them up,” and to the south, “Do not withhold; bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth—&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-7">everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-8">Bring forth the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-9">Let all the nations gather together, and let the peoples assemble. Who among them declared this, and foretold to us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to justify them, and let them hear and say, “It is true.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-10">You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-11">I, I am the Lord, and besides me there is no savior.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-12">I declared and saved and proclaimed, when there was no strange god among you; and you are my witnesses, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-13">I am God, and also henceforth I am He; there is no one who can deliver from my hand; I work and who can hinder it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-14">Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I will send to Babylon and break down all the bars, and the shouting of the Chaldeans will be turned to lamentation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-15">I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-16">Thus says the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-17">who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior; they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-18">Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-19">I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-20">The wild animals will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-21">the people whom I formed for myself so that they might declare my praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-22">Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-23">You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings, or honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, or wearied you with frankincense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-24">You have not bought me sweet cane with money, or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins; you have wearied me with your iniquities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-25">I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-26">Accuse me, let us go to trial; set forth your case, so that you may be proved right.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-27">Your first ancestor sinned, and your interpreters transgressed against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-43-28">Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, I delivered Jacob to utter destruction, and Israel to reviling.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+42/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+44/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
