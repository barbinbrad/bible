Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-25">But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-26">And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-27">They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-28">At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-30">Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-31">He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-32">That evening, at sunset, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-33">And the whole city was gathered around the door.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-34">And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-35">In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-36">And Simon and his companions hunted for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-37">When they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-38">He answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-39">And he went throughout Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-40">A leper came to him begging him, and kneeling he said to him, “If you choose, you can make me clean.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-41">Moved with pity, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I do choose. Be made clean!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-42">Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-43">After sternly warning him he sent him away at once,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-44">saying to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-45">But he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer go into a town openly, but stayed out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
