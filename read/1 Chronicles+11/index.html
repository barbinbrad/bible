Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-6">And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-7">And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-8">And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-9">And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-10">Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-11">And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-12">And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-13">He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-14">And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-15">And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-16">And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-17">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-18">And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-19">and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with  their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-20">And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-21">Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the  three.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-22">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two  Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-23">And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-24">These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-11-25">Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the  three: and David set him over his guard.&nbsp;</span><span
