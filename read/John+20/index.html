He saw the linen wrappings lying there,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-7">and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-8">Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-9">for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-10">Then the disciples returned to their homes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-11">But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-12">and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-13">They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-14">When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-15">Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-16">Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-17">Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-18">Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-19">When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-20">After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-21">Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-22">When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-23">If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-24">But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-25">So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-26">A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-27">Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-28">Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-29">Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-30">Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-31">But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
