She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-14">When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-15">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-16">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-17">Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-18">Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and  he had said these things unto her.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-19">When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first  of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace  unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-20">And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-21">Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace  unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-23">whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever  ye retain, they are retained.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace  unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-27">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach  thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-28">Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-29">Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed  they that have not seen, and  have believed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-30">Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-20-31">but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
