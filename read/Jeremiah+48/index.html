Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Alas for Nebo, it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; the fortress is put to shame and broken down;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-2">the renown of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they planned evil against her: “Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!” You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-3">Hark! a cry from Horonaim, “Desolation and great destruction!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-4">“Moab is destroyed!” her little ones cry out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-5">For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping bitterly; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distressing cry of anguish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-6">Flee! Save yourselves! Be like a wild ass in the desert!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-7">Surely, because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you also shall be taken; Chemosh shall go out into exile, with his priests and his attendants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-8">The destroyer shall come upon every town, and no town shall escape; the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the Lord has spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-9">Set aside salt for Moab, for she will surely fall; her towns shall become a desolation, with no inhabitant in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-10">Accursed is the one who is slack in doing the work of the Lord; and accursed is the one who keeps back the sword from bloodshed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-11">Moab has been at ease from his youth, settled like wine on its dregs; he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into exile; therefore his flavor has remained and his aroma is unspoiled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-12">Therefore, the time is surely coming, says the Lord, when I shall send to him decanters to decant him, and empty his vessels, and break his jars in pieces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-13">Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-14">How can you say, “We are heroes and mighty warriors”?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-15">The destroyer of Moab and his towns has come up, and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter, says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-16">The calamity of Moab is near at hand and his doom approaches swiftly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-17">Mourn over him, all you his neighbors, and all who know his name; say, “How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-18">Come down from glory, and sit on the parched ground, enthroned daughter Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; he has destroyed your strongholds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-19">Stand by the road and watch, you inhabitant of Aroer! Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping; say, “What has happened?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-20">Moab is put to shame, for it is broken down; wail and cry! Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-21">Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mephaath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-22">and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-23">and Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-24">and Kerioth, and Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-25">The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-26">Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the Lord; let Moab wallow in his vomit; he too shall become a laughingstock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-27">Israel was a laughingstock for you, though he was not caught among thieves; but whenever you spoke of him you shook your head!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-28">Leave the towns, and live on the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like the dove that nests on the sides of the mouth of a gorge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-29">We have heard of the pride of Moab— he is very proud— of his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-30">I myself know his insolence, says the Lord; his boasts are false, his deeds are false.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-31">Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for all Moab; for the people of Kir-heres I mourn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-32">More than for Jazer I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches crossed over the sea, reached as far as Jazer; upon your summer fruits and your vintage the destroyer has fallen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-33">Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of Moab; I have stopped the wine from the wine presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy; the shouting is not the shout of joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-34">Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. For even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-35">And I will bring to an end in Moab, says the Lord, those who offer sacrifice at a high place and make offerings to their gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-36">Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the people of Kir-heres; for the riches they gained have perished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-37">For every head is shaved and every beard cut off; on all the hands there are gashes, and on the loins sackcloth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-38">On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel that no one wants, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-39">How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all his neighbors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-40">For thus says the Lord: Look, he shall swoop down like an eagle, and spread his wings against Moab;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-41">the towns shall be taken and the strongholds seized. The hearts of the warriors of Moab, on that day, shall be like the heart of a woman in labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-42">Moab shall be destroyed as a people, because he magnified himself against the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-43">Terror, pit, and trap are before you, O inhabitants of Moab! says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-44">Everyone who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and everyone who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the trap. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-45">In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop exhausted; for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the house of Sihon; it has destroyed the forehead of Moab, the scalp of the people of tumult.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-46">Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished, for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-48-47">Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment on Moab.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+47/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+49/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
