and they said, We will not come up:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-13">is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-14">Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-15">And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-16">And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-17">and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-18">And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-19">And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-20">And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-21">Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-22">And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-23">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-24">Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-25">And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-26">And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-27">So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-28">And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for  not  of mine own mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-29">If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-30">But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-31">And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-32">and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-33">So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-34">And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-35">And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-36">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-37">Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-38">even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-39">And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-40">to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-41">But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-42">And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-43">And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-44">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-45">Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-46">And Moses said unto Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-47">And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-48">And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-49">Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-50">And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
