A city set on a hill cannot be hid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-15">Neither do  light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-16">Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-17">Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-18">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-19">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-20">For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed  of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-21">Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-22">but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-23">If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-24">leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-25">Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-26">Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-27">Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-28">but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-29">And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-30">And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-31">It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-32">but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-33">Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-34">but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-35">nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-36">Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-37">But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil .&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-38">Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-39">but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-40">And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-41">And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-42">Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-43">Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-44">but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-45">that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-46">For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-47">And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more ? do not even the Gentiles the same?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-48">Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
