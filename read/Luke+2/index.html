and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-8">And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-9">And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-10">And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-11">for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-12">And this  the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-14">Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-15">And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-16">And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-17">And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-18">And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-19">But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-21">And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-22">And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-23">(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-24">and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-25">And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-26">And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-27">And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-28">then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-29">Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord, According to thy word, in peace;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-30">For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-31">Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-32">A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of thy people Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-33">And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-34">and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this  is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-35">yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-36">And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-37">and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-38">And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-39">And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-40">And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-41">And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-42">And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-43">and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-44">but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-45">and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-46">And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-47">and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-48">And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-49">And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-50">And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-51">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all sayings in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-52">And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
