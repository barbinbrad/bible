for see—I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-11">to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-12">This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-14">“Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-15">When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-16">So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-17">When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-18">and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-19">But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-20">The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-21">After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-22">When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-23">(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord”),&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-24">and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-26">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-27">Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-28">Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-29">“Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-30">for my eyes have seen your salvation,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-31">which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-32">a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-33">And the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-34">Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-35">so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your own soul too.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-36">There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-37">then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-38">At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-39">When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-40">The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-41">Now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-42">And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-43">When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-44">Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-45">When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-46">After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-47">And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-48">When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-49">He said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-50">But they did not understand what he said to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-51">Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-2-52">And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
