for they are a rebellious house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-3">Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-4">And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-5">Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-6">In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-7">And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-8">And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-9">Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-10">Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden  the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-11">Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-12">And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-13">My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-14">And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-15">And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-16">But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-17">Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-18">Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-19">and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate,  of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-20">And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-21">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-22">Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-23">Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-24">For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-25">For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-26">Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-27">Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-12-28">Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
