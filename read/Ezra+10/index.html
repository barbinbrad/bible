So they swore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-6">Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, where he spent the night. He did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-7">They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-8">and that if any did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all their property should be forfeited, and they themselves banned from the congregation of the exiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-9">Then all the people of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-10">Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-11">Now make confession to the Lord the God of your ancestors, and do his will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-12">Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “It is so; we must do as you have said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-13">But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for many of us have transgressed in this matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-14">Let our officials represent the whole assembly, and let all in our towns who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every town, until the fierce wrath of our God on this account is averted from us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-15">Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levites supported them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-16">Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, heads of families, according to their families, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-17">By the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-18">There were found of the descendants of the priests who had married foreign women, of the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-19">They pledged themselves to send away their wives, and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-20">Of the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-21">Of the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-22">Of the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-23">Of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-24">Of the singers: Eliashib.
