Of Ithamar, Daniel. Of David, Hattush,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-3">of the descendants of Shecaniah. Of Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered one hundred fifty males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-4">Of the descendants of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-5">Of the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-6">Of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-7">Of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-8">Of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-9">Of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred eighteen males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-10">Of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred sixty males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-11">Of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-12">Of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred ten males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-13">Of the descendants of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-14">Of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them seventy males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-15">I gathered them by the river that runs to Ahava, and there we camped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the descendants of Levi.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-16">Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-17">and sent them to Iddo, the leader at the place called Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his colleagues the temple servants at Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-18">Since the gracious hand of our God was upon us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the descendants of Mahli son of Levi son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and kin, eighteen;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-19">also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the descendants of Merari, with his kin and their sons, twenty;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-20">besides two hundred twenty of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-21">Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might deny ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-22">For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and his wrath are against all who forsake him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-23">So we fasted and petitioned our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-24">Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kin with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-25">And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel there present had offered;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-26">I weighed out into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and one hundred silver vessels worth . . . talents, and one hundred talents of gold,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-27">twenty gold bowls worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine polished bronze as precious as gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-28">And I said to them, “You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-29">Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of families in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-30">So the priests and the Levites took over the silver, the gold, and the vessels as they were weighed out, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-31">Then we left the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes along the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-32">We came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-33">On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver, the gold, and the vessels were weighed into the hands of the priest Meremoth son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-34">The total was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-35">At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats; all this was a burnt offering to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-8-36">They also delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they supported the people and the house of God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezra+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezra+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
