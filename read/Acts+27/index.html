and he put us therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-8">and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-9">And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-10">and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-11">But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter  a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-14">But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-15">and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way , and were driven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-17">and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-18">And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw  overboard;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-19">and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-20">And when neither sun nor stars shone upon  for many days, and no small tempest lay on , all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-21">And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but  of the ship.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-23">For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-24">saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-25">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-26">But we must be cast upon a certain island.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the  Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-28">and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-29">And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-30">And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-33">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-34">Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-35">And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-36">Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-39">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-40">And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-41">But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence .&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-42">And the soldiersâ€™ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any  should swim out, and escape.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-43">But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-44">and the rest, some on planks, and some on  things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
