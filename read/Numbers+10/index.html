An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-7">But when the assembly is to be gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-8">The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; this shall be a perpetual institution for you throughout your generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-9">When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before the Lord your God and be saved from your enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-10">Also on your days of rejoicing, at your appointed festivals, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over your sacrifices of well-being; they shall serve as a reminder on your behalf before the Lord your God: I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-11">In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-12">Then the Israelites set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-13">They set out for the first time at the command of the Lord by Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-14">The standard of the camp of Judah set out first, company by company, and over the whole company was Nahshon son of Amminadab.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-15">Over the company of the tribe of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-16">and over the company of the tribe of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-17">Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites, who carried the tabernacle, set out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-18">Next the standard of the camp of Reuben set out, company by company; and over the whole company was Elizur son of Shedeur.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-19">Over the company of the tribe of Simeon was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-20">and over the company of the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-21">Then the Kohathites, who carried the holy things, set out; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-22">Next the standard of the Ephraimite camp set out, company by company, and over the whole company was Elishama son of Ammihud.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-23">Over the company of the tribe of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-24">and over the company of the tribe of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-25">Then the standard of the camp of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out, company by company, and over the whole company was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-26">Over the company of the tribe of Asher was Pagiel son of Ochran,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-27">and over the company of the tribe of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-28">This was the order of march of the Israelites, company by company, when they set out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-29">Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said, ‘I will give it to you’; come with us, and we will treat you well; for the Lord has promised good to Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-30">But he said to him, “I will not go, but I will go back to my own land and to my kindred.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-31">He said, “Do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-32">Moreover, if you go with us, whatever good the Lord does for us, the same we will do for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-33">So they set out from the mount of the Lord three days’ journey with the ark of the covenant of the Lord going before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-34">the cloud of the Lord being over them by day when they set out from the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-35">Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, “Arise, O Lord, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-10-36">And whenever it came to rest, he would say, “Return, O Lord of the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
