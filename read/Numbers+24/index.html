Then the spirit of God came upon him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-3">and he uttered his oracle, saying: “The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is clear,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-4">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, but with eyes uncovered:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-5">how fair are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-6">Like palm groves that stretch far away, like gardens beside a river, like aloes that the Lord has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-7">Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall have abundant water, his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-8">God who brings him out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for him; he shall devour the nations that are his foes and break their bones. He shall strike with his arrows.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-9">He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, and cursed is everyone who curses you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-10">Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but instead you have blessed them these three times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-11">Now be off with you! Go home! I said, ‘I will reward you richly,’ but the Lord has denied you any reward.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-12">And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-13">‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord, to do either good or bad of my own will; what the Lord says, that is what I will say’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-14">So now, I am going to my people; let me advise you what this people will do to your people in days to come.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-15">So he uttered his oracle, saying: “The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is clear,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-16">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, but with his eyes uncovered:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-17">I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near— a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the borderlands of Moab, and the territory of all the Shethites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-18">Edom will become a possession, Seir a possession of its enemies, while Israel does valiantly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-19">One out of Jacob shall rule, and destroy the survivors of Ir.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-20">Then he looked on Amalek, and uttered his oracle, saying: “First among the nations was Amalek, but its end is to perish forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-21">Then he looked on the Kenite, and uttered his oracle, saying: “Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-22">yet Kain is destined for burning. How long shall Asshur take you away captive?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-23">Again he uttered his oracle, saying: “Alas, who shall live when God does this?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-24">But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber; and he also shall perish forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-24-25">Then Balaam got up and went back to his place, and Balak also went his way.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
