Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking. &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-7">And after a time his master’s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-8">But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me here, my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-9">He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-10">And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not consent to lie beside her or to be with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-11">One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work, and while no one else was in the house,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-12">she caught hold of his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-13">When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-14">she called out to the members of her household and said to them, “See, my husband has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us! He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-15">and when he heard me raise my voice and cry out, he left his garment beside me, and fled outside.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-16">Then she kept his garment by her until his master came home,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-17">and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-18">but as soon as I raised my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me, and fled outside.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-19">When his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, saying, “This is the way your servant treated me,” he became enraged.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-20">And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined; he remained there in prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-21">But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love; he gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-22">The chief jailer committed to Joseph’s care all the prisoners who were in the prison, and whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-39-23">The chief jailer paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with him; and whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+38/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+40/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
