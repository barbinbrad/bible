There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priestâ€™s office in his stead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-7">From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-8">At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-9">Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-10">And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-11">And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-12">And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-13">to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-14">Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-15">Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-16">Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-17">For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-18">He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-19">Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-20">Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-21">He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-10-22">Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
