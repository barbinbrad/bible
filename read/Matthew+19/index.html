Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-7">They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-8">He said to them, “It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-9">And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-10">His disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-11">But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-12">For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-13">Then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples spoke sternly to those who brought them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-14">but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-15">And he laid his hands on them and went on his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-16">Then someone came to him and said, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-17">And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-18">He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-19">Honor your father and mother; also, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-20">The young man said to him, “I have kept all these; what do I still lack?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-21">Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-22">When the young man heard this word, he went away grieving, for he had many possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-23">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-24">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-25">When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astounded and said, “Then who can be saved?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-26">But Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-27">Then Peter said in reply, “Look, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-28">Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-29">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-30">But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
