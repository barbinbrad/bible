What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-7">They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put  away?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-8">He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-9">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-10">The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-11">But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-12">For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-13">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-14">But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-15">And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-16">And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-17">And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-18">He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-19">Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-20">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-21">Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-22">But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-23">And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-24">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-25">And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-26">And Jesus looking upon  said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-27">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-28">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-29">And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-19-30">But many shall be last  first; and first  last.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
