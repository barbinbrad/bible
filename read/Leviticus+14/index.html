and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-40">then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-41">and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-42">and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-43">And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-44">then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-45">And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-46">Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-14-47">And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes;
