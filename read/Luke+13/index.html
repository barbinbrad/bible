For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-8">He replied, ‘Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-9">If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-10">Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-11">And just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years. She was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-12">When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, “Woman, you are set free from your ailment.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-13">When he laid his hands on her, immediately she stood up straight and began praising God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-14">But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had cured on the sabbath, kept saying to the crowd, “There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be cured, and not on the sabbath day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-15">But the Lord answered him and said, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger, and lead it away to give it water?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-16">And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-17">When he said this, all his opponents were put to shame; and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-18">He said therefore, “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-19">It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-20">And again he said, “To what should I compare the kingdom of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-21">It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-22">Jesus went through one town and village after another, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-23">Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few be saved?” He said to them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-24">“Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-25">When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then in reply he will say to you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-26">Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-27">But he will say, ‘I do not know where you come from; go away from me, all you evildoers!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-28">There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrown out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-29">Then people will come from east and west, from north and south, and will eat in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-30">Indeed, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-31">At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, “Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-32">He said to them, “Go and tell that fox for me, ‘Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-33">Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-34">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-13-35">See, your house is left to you. And I tell you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
