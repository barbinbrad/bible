As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-5">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-6">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-7">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-8">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and  shall ye be my disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-9">Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-10">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-11">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and  your joy may be made full.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-12">This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-13">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-14">Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-15">No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-16">Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and  your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-17">These things I command you, that ye may love one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-18">If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before  you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-19">If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-20">Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-21">But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-22">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-23">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-24">If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-25">But , that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,  the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-15-27">and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
