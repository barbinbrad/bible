Come, see the place where he lay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-8">So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-9">Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-10">Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-11">While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-12">After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-13">telling them, “You must say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-14">If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-15">So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-16">Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-17">When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-18">And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-19">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-28-20">and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
