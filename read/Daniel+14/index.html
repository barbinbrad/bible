But Daniel worshiped his own God. So the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” &nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-5">He answered, “Because I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-6">The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-7">And Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-8">Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-9">But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.” Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-10">Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-11">The priests of Bel said, “See, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-12">When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-13">They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-14">After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-15">During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-16">Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-17">The king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-18">As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-19">But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. “Look at the floor,” he said, “and notice whose footprints these are.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-20">The king said, “I see the footprints of men and women and children.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-21">Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-22">Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-23">Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-24">The king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-25">Daniel said, “I worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-26">But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-27">Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-28">When the Babylonians heard about it, they were very indignant and conspired against the king, saying, “The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and killed the dragon, and slaughtered the priests.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-29">Going to the king, they said, “Hand Daniel over to us, or else we will kill you and your household.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-30">The king saw that they were pressing him hard, and under compulsion he handed Daniel over to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-31">They threw Daniel into the lions’ den, and he was there for six days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-32">There were seven lions in the den, and every day they had been given two human bodies and two sheep; but now they were given nothing, so that they would devour Daniel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-33">Now the prophet Habakkuk was in Judea; he had made a stew and had broken bread into a bowl, and was going into the field to take it to the reapers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-34">But the angel of the Lord said to Habakkuk, “Take the food that you have to Babylon, to Daniel, in the lions’ den.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-35">Habakkuk said, “Sir, I have never seen Babylon, and I know nothing about the den.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-36">Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown of his head and carried him by his hair; with the speed of the wind he set him down in Babylon, right over the den.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-37">Then Habakkuk shouted, “Daniel, Daniel! Take the food that God has sent you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-38">Daniel said, “You have remembered me, O God, and have not forsaken those who love you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-39">So Daniel got up and ate. And the angel of God immediately returned Habakkuk to his own place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-40">On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-41">The king shouted with a loud voice, “You are great, O Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-14-42">Then he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction, and they were instantly eaten before his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Daniel+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hosea+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
