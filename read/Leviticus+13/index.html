The priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not confine him, for he is unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-12">But if the disease breaks out in the skin, so that it covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-13">then the priest shall make an examination, and if the disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; since it has all turned white, he is clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-14">But if raw flesh ever appears on him, he shall be unclean;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-15">the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-16">But if the raw flesh again turns white, he shall come to the priest;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-17">the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean. He is clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-18">When there is on the skin of one’s body a boil that has healed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-19">and in the place of the boil there appears a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, it shall be shown to the priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-20">The priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; this is a leprous disease, broken out in the boil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-21">But if the priest examines it and the hair on it is not white, nor is it deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-22">If it spreads in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-23">But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; the priest shall pronounce him clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-24">Or, when the body has a burn on the skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-25">the priest shall examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-26">But if the priest examines it and the hair in the spot is not white, and it is no deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-27">The priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-28">But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin but has abated, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-29">When a man or woman has a disease on the head or in the beard,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-30">the priest shall examine the disease. If it appears deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-31">If the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall confine the person with the itching disease for seven days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-32">On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-33">he shall shave, but the itch he shall not shave. The priest shall confine the person with the itch for seven days more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-34">On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-35">But if the itch spreads in the skin after he was pronounced clean,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-36">the priest shall examine him. If the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-37">But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-38">When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-39">the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-40">If anyone loses the hair from his head, he is bald but he is clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-41">If he loses the hair from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-42">But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-43">The priest shall examine him; if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, which resembles a leprous disease in the skin of the body,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-44">he is leprous, he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; the disease is on his head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-45">The person who has the leprous disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head be disheveled; and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, “Unclean, unclean.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-46">He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-47">Concerning clothing: when a leprous disease appears in it, in woolen or linen cloth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-48">in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-49">if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-50">The priest shall examine the disease, and put the diseased article aside for seven days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-51">He shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the cloth, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, this is a spreading leprous disease; it is unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-52">He shall burn the clothing, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a spreading leprous disease; it shall be burned in fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-53">If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the clothing, in warp or woof or in anything of skin,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-54">the priest shall command them to wash the article in which the disease appears, and he shall put it aside seven days more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-55">The priest shall examine the diseased article after it has been washed. If the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in fire, whether the leprous spot is on the inside or on the outside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-56">If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has abated after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the cloth, in warp or woof, or out of skin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-57">If it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which the disease appears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-58">But the cloth, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease disappears when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and it shall be clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-13-59">This is the ritual for a leprous disease in a cloth of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
