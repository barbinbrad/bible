and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-4">And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-5">And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-6">Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-7">And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and  between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-8">He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-9">Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-10">And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-11">And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-12">and a border before the lodges, one cubit , and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-13">And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-14">He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court  unto the posts, round about the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-15">And  the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-16">And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon  post were palm-trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-17">Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-18">And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-19">Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits,  on the east and on the north.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-20">And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-21">And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-22">And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-23">And there was a gate to the inner court over against the  gate,  on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-24">And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-25">And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-26">And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-27">And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-28">Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-29">and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-30">And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-31">And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-32">And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-33">and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-34">And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-35">And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured  according to these measures;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-36">the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-37">And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-38">And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-39">And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-40">And on the  side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-41">Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew .&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-42">And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-43">And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-44">And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-45">And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-46">and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-47">And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-48">Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-49">The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+39/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+41/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
