The length of the measuring reed in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-6">Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. There were&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-7">recesses, and each recess was one reed wide and one reed deep; and the space between the recesses, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end was one reed deep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-8">Then he measured the inner vestibule of the gateway, one cubit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-9">Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its pilasters, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-10">There were three recesses on either side of the east gate; the three were of the same size; and the pilasters on either side were of the same size.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-11">Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the width of the gateway, thirteen cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-12">There was a barrier before the recesses, one cubit on either side; and the recesses were six cubits on either side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-13">Then he measured the gate from the back of the one recess to the back of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, from wall to wall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-14">He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and the gate next to the pilaster on every side of the court.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-15">From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-16">The recesses and their pilasters had windows, with shutters on the inside of the gateway all around, and the vestibules also had windows on the inside all around; and on the pilasters were palm trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-17">Then he brought me into the outer court; there were chambers there, and a pavement, all around the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-18">The pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-19">Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, one hundred cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-20">Then he measured the gate of the outer court that faced north—its depth and width.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-21">Its recesses, three on either side, and its pilasters and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-22">Its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. Seven steps led up to it; and its vestibule was on the inside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-23">Opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court; he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-24">Then he led me toward the south, and there was a gate on the south; and he measured its pilasters and its vestibule; they had the same dimensions as the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-25">There were windows all around in it and in its vestibule, like the windows of the others; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-26">There were seven steps leading up to it; its vestibule was on the inside. It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on either side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-27">There was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-28">Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same dimensions as the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-29">Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-30">There were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits deep and five cubits wide.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-31">Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pilasters, and its stairway had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-32">Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-33">Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same dimensions as the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-34">Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters, on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-35">Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same dimensions as the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-36">Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and it had windows all around. Its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-37">Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters, on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-38">There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-39">And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-40">On the outside of the vestibule at the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-41">Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-42">There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-43">There were pegs, one handbreadth long, fastened all around the inside. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-44">On the outside of the inner gateway there were chambers for the singers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the east gate facing north.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-45">He said to me, “This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-46">and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the descendants of Zadok, who alone among the descendants of Levi may come near to the Lord to minister to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-47">He measured the court, one hundred cubits deep, and one hundred cubits wide, a square; and the altar was in front of the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-48">Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the pilasters of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-40-49">The depth of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width twelve cubits; ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars beside the pilasters on either side.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+39/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+41/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
