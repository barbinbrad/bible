Your kingdom come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-3">Give us each day our daily bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-4">And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-5">And he said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-6">for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-7">And he answers from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-8">I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-9">“So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-10">For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-11">Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-12">Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-13">If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-14">Now he was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had gone out, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-15">But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-16">Others, to test him, kept demanding from him a sign from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-17">But he knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert, and house falls on house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-18">If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? —for you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-19">Now if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-20">But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-21">When a strong man, fully armed, guards his castle, his property is safe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-22">But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-23">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-24">“When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place, but not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-25">When it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-26">Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-27">While he was saying this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-28">But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-29">When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-30">For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be to this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-31">The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-32">The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and see, something greater than Jonah is here!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-33">“No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar, but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-34">Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light; but if it is not healthy, your body is full of darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-35">Therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-36">If then your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-37">While he was speaking, a Pharisee invited him to dine with him; so he went in and took his place at the table.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-38">The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-39">Then the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-40">You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-41">So give for alms those things that are within; and see, everything will be clean for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-42">“But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds, and neglect justice and the love of God; it is these you ought to have practiced, without neglecting the others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-43">Woe to you Pharisees! For you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-44">Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without realizing it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-45">One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us too.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-46">And he said, “Woe also to you lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-47">Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-48">So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; for they killed them, and you build their tombs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-49">Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-50">so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-51">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-52">Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-53">When he went outside, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile toward him and to cross-examine him about many things,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-11-54">lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
