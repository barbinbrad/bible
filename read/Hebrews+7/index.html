but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-9">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-10">for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-11">Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need  that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-13">For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-14">For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-15">And  is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-16">who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-17">for it is witnessed , Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-18">For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-20">And inasmuch as  not without the taking of an oath&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-21">(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-22">by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-23">And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-24">but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-25">Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-26">For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-27">who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the  of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-28">For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law,  a Son, perfected for evermore.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
