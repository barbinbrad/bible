Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-5">And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their kindred, though these also are descended from Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-6">But this man, who does not belong to their ancestry, collected tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-7">It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-8">In the one case, tithes are received by those who are mortal; in the other, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-9">One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-10">for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-11">Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood—for the people received the law under this priesthood—what further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than one according to the order of Aaron?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-12">For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-13">Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-14">For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-15">It is even more obvious when another priest arises, resembling Melchizedek,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-16">one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but through the power of an indestructible life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-17">For it is attested of him, “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-18">There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-19">(for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-20">This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their office without an oath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-21">but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever’”—&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-22">accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-23">Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-24">but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-25">Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-26">For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-27">Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-7-28">For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
