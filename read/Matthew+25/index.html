Come ye forth to meet him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-9">But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-10">And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-13">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-14">For  as  a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-16">Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-17">In like manner he also that  the two gained other two.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-18">But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-19">Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-20">And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-21">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-22">And he also that  the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-24">And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-25">and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-26">But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-27">thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-30">And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-31">But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-32">and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-33">and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-34">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-35">for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-36">naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-25-37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee?
