Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-14">I have good advice and sound wisdom; I have insight, I have strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-15">By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-16">by me rulers rule, and nobles, all who govern rightly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-18">Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and prosperity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-19">My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-20">I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-21">endowing with wealth those who love me, and filling their treasuries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-22">The Lord created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-23">Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-24">When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-25">Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth—&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-26">when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world’s first bits of soil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-27">When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-28">when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-29">when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-30">then I was beside him, like a master worker; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-31">rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-32">“And now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-33">Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-34">Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-35">For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-36">but those who miss me injure themselves;
