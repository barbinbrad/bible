And my voice is to the sons of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-5">O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-7">For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-11">For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-12">I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge  discretion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-13">The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-14">Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-15">By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-16">By me princes rule, And nobles,  all the judges of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-17">I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-18">Riches and honor are with me; , durable wealth and righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-19">My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-20">I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-22">Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-25">Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-27">When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-28">When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-29">When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-30">Then I was by him,  a master workman; And I was daily  delight, Rejoicing always before him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-31">Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-32">Now therefore,  sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-33">Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Prov-8-36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Proverbs+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Proverbs+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
