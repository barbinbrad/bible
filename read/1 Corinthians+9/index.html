Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-2">If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-3">This is my defense to those who would examine me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-4">Do we not have the right to our food and drink?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-5">Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-6">Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-7">Who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-8">Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law also say the same?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-9">For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-10">Or does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was indeed written for our sake, for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-11">If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-12">If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we still more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ. &nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-13">Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-14">In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-15">But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing this so that they may be applied in my case. Indeed, I would rather die than that—no one will deprive me of my ground for boasting!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-16">If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-17">For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-18">What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-19">For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-20">To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-21">To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law) so that I might win those outside the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-22">To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-23">I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-24">Do you not know that in a race the runners all compete, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-25">Athletes exercise self-control in all things; they do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable one.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-26">So I do not run aimlessly, nor do I box as though beating the air;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-27">but I punish my body and enslave it, so that after proclaiming to others I myself should not be disqualified.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
