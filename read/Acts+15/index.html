and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me: &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-14">Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-15">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-16">After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-17">That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-18">Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-19">Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-20">but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-21">For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; , Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-23">and they wrote  by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-24">Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-25">it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-26">men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-29">that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-30">So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-31">And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-32">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-33">And after they had spent some time , they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-34">But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-35">And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord,  how they fare.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-36">And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-37">But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-38">And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-39">but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-40">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
