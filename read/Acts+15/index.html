Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-18">known from long ago.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-19">Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-20">but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-21">For in every city, for generations past, Moses has had those who proclaim him, for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-22">Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brothers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-23">with the following letter: “The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the believers of Gentile origin in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-24">Since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us, though with no instructions from us, have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-25">we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-26">who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-27">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-28">For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-29">that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-30">So they were sent off and went down to Antioch. When they gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-31">When its members read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-32">Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-33">After they had been there for some time, they were sent off in peace by the believers to those who had sent them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-34">But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, and there, with many others, they taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-35">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Come, let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-36">Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-37">But Paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-38">The disagreement became so sharp that they parted company; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-39">But Paul chose Silas and set out, the believers commending him to the grace of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-15-40">He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
