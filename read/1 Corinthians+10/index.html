For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-5">Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-6">Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-7">Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-8">We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-9">We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-10">And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-11">These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-12">So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-13">No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-14">Therefore, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-15">I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-16">The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-17">Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-18">Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-19">What do I imply then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-20">No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-21">You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-22">Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-23">“All things are lawful,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-24">Do not seek your own advantage, but that of the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-25">Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-26">for “the earth and its fullness are the Lord’s.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-27">If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-28">But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience—&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-29">I mean the other’s conscience, not your own. For why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone else’s conscience?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-30">If I partake with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of that for which I give thanks?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-31">So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-32">Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-10-33">just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
