He shall be free at home one year, to be happy with the wife whom he has married.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-6">No one shall take a mill or an upper millstone in pledge, for that would be taking a life in pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-7">If someone is caught kidnaping another Israelite, enslaving or selling the Israelite, then that kidnaper shall die. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-8">Guard against an outbreak of a leprous skin disease by being very careful; you shall carefully observe whatever the levitical priests instruct you, just as I have commanded them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-9">Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam on your journey out of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-10">When you make your neighbor a loan of any kind, you shall not go into the house to take the pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-11">You shall wait outside, while the person to whom you are making the loan brings the pledge out to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-12">If the person is poor, you shall not sleep in the garment given you as the pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-13">You shall give the pledge back by sunset, so that your neighbor may sleep in the cloak and bless you; and it will be to your credit before the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-14">You shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other Israelites or aliens who reside in your land in one of your towns.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-15">You shall pay them their wages daily before sunset, because they are poor and their livelihood depends on them; otherwise they might cry to the Lord against you, and you would incur guilt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-16">Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their parents; only for their own crimes may persons be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-17">You shall not deprive a resident alien or an orphan of justice; you shall not take a widow’s garment in pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-18">Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you from there; therefore I command you to do this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-19">When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be left for the alien, the orphan, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your undertakings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-20">When you beat your olive trees, do not strip what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-21">When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-22">Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
