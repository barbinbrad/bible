These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-16">When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels at their side did not veer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-17">When they stopped, the others stopped, and when they rose up, the others rose up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-18">Then the glory of the Lord went out from the threshold of the house and stopped above the cherubim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-19">The cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight as they went out with the wheels beside them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord; and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-20">These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-21">Each had four faces, each four wings, and underneath their wings something like human hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-22">As for what their faces were like, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar.
