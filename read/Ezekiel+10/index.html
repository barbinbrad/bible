And he went in in my sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-3">Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-4">And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub,  over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-5">And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-6">And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling , from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-7">And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-8">And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-9">And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-10">And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-11">When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-12">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,  the wheels that they four had.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-13">As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling .&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-14">And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-15">And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-16">And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-17">When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-18">And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-19">And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-20">This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-21">Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-10-22">And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
