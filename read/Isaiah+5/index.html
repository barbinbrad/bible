My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-2">and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-3">And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-5">And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-6">and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-7">For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-8">Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-9">In mine ears  Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-10">For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield  an ephah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-11">Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-12">And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are  their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-13">Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-14">Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend .&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-15">And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-16">but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-17">Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-18">Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-19">that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-20">Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-21">Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-22">Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-23">that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-25">Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-26">And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-27">None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-28">whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horsesâ€™ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-29">their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-5-30">And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness  distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
