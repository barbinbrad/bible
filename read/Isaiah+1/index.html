Why do you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-6">From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they have not been drained, or bound up, or softened with oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-7">Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-8">And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-9">If the Lord of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-10">Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-11">What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-12">When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-13">bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation— I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-14">Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-15">When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-16">Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-17">learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-18">Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-19">If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-20">but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-21">How the faithful city has become a whore! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her— but now murderers!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-22">Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-23">Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the orphan, and the widow’s cause does not come before them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-24">Therefore says the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will pour out my wrath on my enemies, and avenge myself on my foes!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-25">I will turn my hand against you; I will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-26">And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-27">Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-28">But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-29">For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-30">For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-31">The strong shall become like tinder, and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+51/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
