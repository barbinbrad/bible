For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our ancestors.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-3">The king fell into a rage, and gave orders to have pans and caldrons heated.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-4">These were heated immediately, and he commanded that the tongue of their spokesman be cut out and that they scalp him and cut off his hands and feet, while the rest of the brothers and the mother looked on.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-5">When he was utterly helpless, the king ordered them to take him to the fire, still breathing, and to fry him in a pan. The smoke from the pan spread widely, but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-6">“The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us, as Moses declared in his song that bore witness against the people to their faces, when he said, ‘And he will have compassion on his servants.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-7">After the first brother had died in this way, they brought forward the second for their sport. They tore off the skin of his head with the hair, and asked him, “Will you eat rather than have your body punished limb by limb?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-8">He replied in the language of his ancestors and said to them, “No.” Therefore he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-9">And when he was at his last breath, he said, “You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-10">After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-11">and said nobly, “I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-12">As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man’s spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-13">After he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same way.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-14">When he was near death, he said, “One cannot but choose to die at the hands of mortals and to cherish the hope God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-15">Next they brought forward the fifth and maltreated him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-16">But he looked at the king, and said, “Because you have authority among mortals, though you also are mortal, you do what you please. But do not think that God has forsaken our people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-17">Keep on, and see how his mighty power will torture you and your descendants!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-18">After him they brought forward the sixth. And when he was about to die, he said, “Do not deceive yourself in vain. For we are suffering these things on our own account, because of our sins against our own God. Therefore astounding things have happened.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-19">But do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to fight against God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-20">The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Although she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-21">She encouraged each of them in the language of their ancestors. Filled with a noble spirit, she reinforced her woman’s reasoning with a man’s courage, and said to them,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-22">“I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-23">Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of humankind and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-24">Antiochus felt that he was being treated with contempt, and he was suspicious of her reproachful tone. The youngest brother being still alive, Antiochus not only appealed to him in words, but promised with oaths that he would make him rich and enviable if he would turn from the ways of his ancestors, and that he would take him for his Friend and entrust him with public affairs.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-25">Since the young man would not listen to him at all, the king called the mother to him and urged her to advise the youth to save himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-26">After much urging on his part, she undertook to persuade her son.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-27">But, leaning close to him, she spoke in their native language as follows, deriding the cruel tyrant: “My son, have pity on me. I carried you nine months in my womb, and nursed you for three years, and have reared you and brought you up to this point in your life, and have taken care of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-28">I beg you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. And in the same way the human race came into being.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-29">Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God’s mercy I may get you back again along with your brothers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-30">While she was still speaking, the young man said, “What are you waiting for? I will not obey the king’s command, but I obey the command of the law that was given to our ancestors through Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-31">But you, who have contrived all sorts of evil against the Hebrews, will certainly not escape the hands of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-32">For we are suffering because of our own sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-33">And if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-34">But you, unholy wretch, you most defiled of all mortals, do not be elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes, when you raise your hand against the children of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-35">You have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty, all-seeing God.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-36">For our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of ever-flowing life, under God’s covenant; but you, by the judgment of God, will receive just punishment for your arrogance.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-37">I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our ancestors, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by trials and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-38">and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty that has justly fallen on our whole nation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-39">The king fell into a rage, and handled him worse than the others, being exasperated at his scorn.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-40">So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-41">Last of all, the mother died, after her sons.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-7-42">Let this be enough, then, about the eating of sacrifices and the extreme tortures.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Maccabees+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Maccabees+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
