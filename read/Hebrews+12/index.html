God is treating you as children; for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-8">If you do not have that discipline in which all children share, then you are illegitimate and not his children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-9">Moreover, we had human parents to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not be even more willing to be subject to the Father of spirits and live?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-10">For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share his holiness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-11">Now, discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-12">Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-13">and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-14">Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-15">See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and through it many become defiled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-16">See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person, who sold his birthright for a single meal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-17">You know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, even though he sought the blessing with tears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-18">You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-19">and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-20">(For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-21">Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”)&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-22">But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-23">and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-24">and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-25">See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven!&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-26">At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-27">This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what is shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-28">Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-29">for indeed our God is a consuming fire.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
