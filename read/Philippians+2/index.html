And being found in human form,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-8">he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-9">Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-10">so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-11">and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-12">Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-13">for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-14">Do all things without murmuring and arguing,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-15">so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine like stars in the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-16">It is by your holding fast to the word of life that I can boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-17">But even if I am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you—&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-18">and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-19">I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be cheered by news of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-20">I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-21">All of them are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-22">But Timothy’s worth you know, how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-23">I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see how things go with me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-24">and I trust in the Lord that I will also come soon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-25">Still, I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus—my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, your messenger and minister to my need;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-26">for he has been longing for all of you, and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-27">He was indeed so ill that he nearly died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-28">I am the more eager to send him, therefore, in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-29">Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy, and honor such people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-30">because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Philippians+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Philippians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
