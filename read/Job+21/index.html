Why should I not be impatient?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-5">Look at me, and be appalled, and lay your hand upon your mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-6">When I think of it I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-7">Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-8">Their children are established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-9">Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-10">Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and never miscarries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-11">They send out their little ones like a flock, and their children dance around.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-12">They sing to the tambourine and the lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-13">They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-14">They say to God, ‘Leave us alone! We do not desire to know your ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-16">Is not their prosperity indeed their own achievement? The plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-17">“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? How often does calamity come upon them? How often does God distribute pains in his anger?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-18">How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-19">You say, ‘God stores up their iniquity for their children.’ Let it be paid back to them, so that they may know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-20">Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-21">For what do they care for their household after them, when the number of their months is cut off?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-22">Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those that are on high?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-23">One dies in full prosperity, being wholly at ease and secure,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-24">his loins full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-25">Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-26">They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-27">“Oh, I know your thoughts, and your schemes to wrong me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-28">For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-29">Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-30">that the wicked are spared in the day of calamity, and are rescued in the day of wrath?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-31">Who declares their way to their face, and who repays them for what they have done?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-32">When they are carried to the grave, a watch is kept over their tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-33">The clods of the valley are sweet to them; everyone will follow after, and those who went before are innumerable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-34">How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
