he gave gifts to his people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-9">(When it says, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-10">He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-11">The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-12">to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-13">until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-14">We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-15">But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-16">from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-17">Now this I affirm and insist on in the Lord: you must no longer live as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-18">They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-19">They have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-20">That is not the way you learned Christ!&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-21">For surely you have heard about him and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-22">You were taught to put away your former way of life, your old self, corrupt and deluded by its lusts,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-23">and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-24">and to clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-25">So then, putting away falsehood, let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors, for we are members of one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-26">Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-27">and do not make room for the devil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-28">Thieves must give up stealing; rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands, so as to have something to share with the needy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-29">Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to those who hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-30">And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-31">Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-4-32">and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ephesians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ephesians+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
