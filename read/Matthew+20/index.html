And they went their way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-5">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-6">And about the eleventh  he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-7">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-8">And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-9">And when they came that  about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-10">And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-11">And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-12">saying, These last have spent  one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-13">But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-14">Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-15">Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-16">So the last shall be first, and the first last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-17">And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-18">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-19">and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping , and asking a certain thing of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-21">And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-22">But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-23">He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on  left hand, is not mine to give; but  for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-24">And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-25">But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-26">Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-27">and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-28">even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-29">And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-30">And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-31">And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-32">And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-33">They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-20-34">And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
