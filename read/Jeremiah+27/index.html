Why should this city become a desolation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-27-18">If indeed they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, then let them intercede with the Lord of hosts, that the vessels left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-27-19">For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-27-20">which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-27-21">thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-27-22">They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall stay, until the day when I give attention to them, says the Lord.
