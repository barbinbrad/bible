And this is the name by which it will be called: “The Lord is our righteousness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-17">For thus says the Lord: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-18">and the levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to make grain offerings, and to make sacrifices for all time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-19">The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-20">Thus says the Lord: If any of you could break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their appointed time,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-21">only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken, so that he would not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with my ministers the Levites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-22">Just as the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will increase the offspring of my servant David, and the Levites who minister to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-23">The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-24">Have you not observed how these people say, “The two families that the Lord chose have been rejected by him,” and how they hold my people in such contempt that they no longer regard them as a nation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-25">Thus says the Lord: Only if I had not established my covenant with day and night and the ordinances of heaven and earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-33-26">would I reject the offspring of Jacob and of my servant David and not choose any of his descendants as rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
