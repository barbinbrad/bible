Make known among the peoples his doings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-2">Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-3">Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-4">Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-5">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-6">O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-7">He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-8">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-9">which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-10">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-11">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-12">When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-13">And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-14">He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-15">, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-16">And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-17">He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-18">His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in  iron,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-19">Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-20">The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-21">He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-22">To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-23">Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-24">And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-25">He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-26">He sent Moses his servant,  Aaron whom he had chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-27">They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-28">He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-29">He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-30">Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-31">He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-32">He gave them hail for rain,  flaming fire in their land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-33">He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-34">He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-35">And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-36">He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-37">And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-38">Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-39">He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-40">They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-41">He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places  a river.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-42">For he remembered his holy word,  Abraham his servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-43">And he brought forth his people with joy,  his chosen with singing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-44">And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-45">That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+104/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+106/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
