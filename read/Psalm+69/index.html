My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-4">More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; many are those who would destroy me, my enemies who accuse me falsely. What I did not steal must I now restore?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-5">O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-6">Do not let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, O Lord God of hosts; do not let those who seek you be dishonored because of me, O God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-7">It is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has covered my face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-8">I have become a stranger to my kindred, an alien to my mother’s children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-9">It is zeal for your house that has consumed me; the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-10">When I humbled my soul with fasting, they insulted me for doing so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-11">When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-12">I am the subject of gossip for those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-13">But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love, answer me. With your faithful help &nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-14">rescue me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-15">Do not let the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the Pit close its mouth over me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-16">Answer me, O Lord, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-17">Do not hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress—make haste to answer me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-18">Draw near to me, redeem me, set me free because of my enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-19">You know the insults I receive, and my shame and dishonor; my foes are all known to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-20">Insults have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-21">They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-22">Let their table be a trap for them, a snare for their allies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-23">Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-24">Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-25">May their camp be a desolation; let no one live in their tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-26">For they persecute those whom you have struck down, and those whom you have wounded, they attack still more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-27">Add guilt to their guilt; may they have no acquittal from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-28">Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-29">But I am lowly and in pain; let your salvation, O God, protect me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-30">I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-31">This will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-32">Let the oppressed see it and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-33">For the Lord hears the needy, and does not despise his own that are in bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-34">Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-35">For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and his servants shall live there and possess it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-36">the children of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall live in it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+68/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+70/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
