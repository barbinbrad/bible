For the waters are come in unto my soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-2">I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-3">I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-4">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-5">O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-6">Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-7">Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-8">I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my motherâ€™s children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-9">For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-10">When I wept,  my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-11">When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-12">They that sit in the gate talk of me; And  the song of the drunkards.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-13">But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-14">Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-15">Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-16">Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-17">And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-18">Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-19">Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-20">Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-21">They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-22">Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace,  a trap.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-23">Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-24">Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-25">Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-26">For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-27">Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-28">Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-29">But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-30">I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-31">And it will please Jehovah better than an ox,  a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-32">The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-33">For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-34">Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-35">For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-69-36">The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+68/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+70/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
