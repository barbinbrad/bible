Then would I fly away, and be at rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-7">Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. &nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-8">I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-9">Destroy, O Lord,  divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-10">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-11">Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-12">For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-13">But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-14">We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-15">Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-16">As for me, I will call upon God; And Jehovah will save me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-17">Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-18">He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many  with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-19">God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old,   who have no changes, And who fear not God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-20">He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-21">His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-22">Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-55-23">But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+54/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+56/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
