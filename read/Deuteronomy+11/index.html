The eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-13">If you will only heed his every commandment that I am commanding you today—loving the Lord your God, and serving him with all your heart and with all your soul—&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-14">then he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, and you will gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-15">and he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat your fill.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-16">Take care, or you will be seduced into turning away, serving other gods and worshiping them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-17">for then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain and the land will yield no fruit; then you will perish quickly off the good land that the Lord is giving you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-18">You shall put these words of mine in your heart and soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and fix them as an emblem on your forehead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-19">Teach them to your children, talking about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-20">Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-21">so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-22">If you will diligently observe this entire commandment that I am commanding you, loving the Lord your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-23">then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and mightier than yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-11-24">Every place on which you set foot shall be yours;
