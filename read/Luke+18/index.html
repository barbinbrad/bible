Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-9">And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-12">I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-13">But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-14">I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-15">And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-16">But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-17">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-19">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one,  God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-20">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-21">And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-22">And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-23">But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-24">And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-25">For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-26">And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-27">But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-28">And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-29">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-30">who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-31">And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-32">For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-33">and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-34">And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-35">And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-36">and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-39">And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-41">What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-42">And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
