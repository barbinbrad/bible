Even in life the human body decays.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-10">A long illness baffles the physician; the king of today will die tomorrow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-11">For when one is dead he inherits maggots and vermin and worms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-12">The beginning of human pride is to forsake the Lord; the heart has withdrawn from its Maker.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-13">For the beginning of pride is sin, and the one who clings to it pours out abominations. Therefore the Lord brings upon them unheard-of calamities, and destroys them completely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-14">The Lord overthrows the thrones of rulers, and enthrones the lowly in their place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-15">The Lord plucks up the roots of the nations, and plants the humble in their place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-16">The Lord lays waste the lands of the nations, and destroys them to the foundations of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-17">He removes some of them and destroys them, and erases the memory of them from the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-18">Pride was not created for human beings, or violent anger for those born of women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-19">Whose offspring are worthy of honor? Human offspring. Whose offspring are worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord. Whose offspring are unworthy of honor? Human offspring. Whose offspring are unworthy of honor? Those who break the commandments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-20">Among family members their leader is worthy of honor, but those who fear the Lord are worthy of honor in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-21">The rich, and the eminent, and the poor— their glory is the fear of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-22">It is not right to despise one who is intelligent but poor, and it is not proper to honor one who is sinful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-23">The prince and the judge and the ruler are honored, but none of them is greater than the one who fears the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-24">Free citizens will serve a wise servant, and an intelligent person will not complain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-25">Do not make a display of your wisdom when you do your work, and do not boast when you are in need.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-26">Better is the worker who has goods in plenty than the boaster who lacks bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-27">My child, honor yourself with humility, and give yourself the esteem you deserve.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-28">Who will acquit those who condemn themselves? And who will honor those who dishonor themselves?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-29">The poor are honored for their knowledge, while the rich are honored for their wealth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-10-30">One who is honored in poverty, how much more in wealth!
