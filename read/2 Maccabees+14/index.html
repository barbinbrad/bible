During that day he kept quiet.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-5">But he found an opportunity that furthered his mad purpose when he was invited by Demetrius to a meeting of the council and was asked about the attitude and intentions of the Jews. He answered:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-6">“Those of the Jews who are called Hasideans, whose leader is Judas Maccabeus, are keeping up war and stirring up sedition, and will not let the kingdom attain tranquility.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-7">Therefore I have laid aside my ancestral glory—I mean the high priesthood—and have now come here,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-8">first because I am genuinely concerned for the interests of the king, and second because I have regard also for my compatriots. For through the folly of those whom I have mentioned our whole nation is now in no small misfortune.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-9">Since you are acquainted, O king, with the details of this matter, may it please you to take thought for our country and our hard-pressed nation with the gracious kindness that you show to all.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-10">For as long as Judas lives, it is impossible for the government to find peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-11">When he had said this, the rest of the king’s Friends, who were hostile to Judas, quickly inflamed Demetrius still more.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-12">He immediately chose Nicanor, who had been in command of the elephants, appointed him governor of Judea, and sent him off&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-13">with orders to kill Judas and scatter his troops, and to install Alcimus as high priest of the great temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-14">And the Gentiles throughout Judea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would mean prosperity for themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-15">When the Jews heard of Nicanor’s coming and the gathering of the Gentiles, they sprinkled dust on their heads and prayed to him who established his own people forever and always upholds his own heritage by manifesting himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-16">At the command of the leader, they set out from there immediately and engaged them in battle at a village called Dessau.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-17">Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, but had been temporarily checked because of the sudden consternation created by the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-18">Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the valor of Judas and his troops and their courage in battle for their country, shrank from deciding the issue by bloodshed.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-19">Therefore he sent Posidonius, Theodotus, and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-20">When the terms had been fully considered, and the leader had informed the people, and it had appeared that they were of one mind, they agreed to the covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-21">The leaders set a day on which to meet by themselves. A chariot came forward from each army; seats of honor were set in place;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-22">Judas posted armed men in readiness at key places to prevent sudden treachery on the part of the enemy; so they duly held the consultation.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-23">Nicanor stayed on in Jerusalem and did nothing out of the way, but dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-24">And he kept Judas always in his presence; he was warmly attached to the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-25">He urged him to marry and have children; so Judas married, settled down, and shared the common life.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-26">But when Alcimus noticed their goodwill for one another, he took the covenant that had been made and went to Demetrius. He told him that Nicanor was disloyal to the government, since he had appointed that conspirator against the kingdom, Judas, to be his successor.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-27">The king became excited and, provoked by the false accusations of that depraved man, wrote to Nicanor, stating that he was displeased with the covenant and commanding him to send Maccabeus to Antioch as a prisoner without delay.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-28">When this message came to Nicanor, he was troubled and grieved that he had to annul their agreement when the man had done no wrong.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-29">Since it was not possible to oppose the king, he watched for an opportunity to accomplish this by a stratagem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-30">But Maccabeus, noticing that Nicanor was more austere in his dealings with him and was meeting him more rudely than had been his custom, concluded that this austerity did not spring from the best motives. So he gathered not a few of his men, and went into hiding from Nicanor.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-31">When the latter became aware that he had been cleverly outwitted by the man, he went to the great and holy temple while the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and commanded them to hand the man over.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-32">When they declared on oath that they did not know where the man was whom he wanted,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-33">he stretched out his right hand toward the sanctuary, and swore this oath: “If you do not hand Judas over to me as a prisoner, I will level this shrine of God to the ground and tear down the altar, and build here a splendid temple to Dionysus.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-34">Having said this, he went away. Then the priests stretched out their hands toward heaven and called upon the constant Defender of our nation, in these words:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-35">“O Lord of all, though you have need of nothing, you were pleased that there should be a temple for your habitation among us;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-36">so now, O holy One, Lord of all holiness, keep undefiled forever this house that has been so recently purified.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-37">A certain Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicanor as a man who loved his compatriots and was very well thought of and for his goodwill was called father of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-38">In former times, when there was no mingling with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and he had most zealously risked body and life for Judaism.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-39">Nicanor, wishing to exhibit the enmity that he had for the Jews, sent more than five hundred soldiers to arrest him;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-40">for he thought that by arresting him he would do them an injury.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-41">When the troops were about to capture the tower and were forcing the door of the courtyard, they ordered that fire be brought and the doors burned. Being surrounded, Razis fell upon his own sword,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-42">preferring to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of sinners and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-43">But in the heat of the struggle he did not hit exactly, and the crowd was now rushing in through the doors. He courageously ran up on the wall, and bravely threw himself down into the crowd.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-44">But as they quickly drew back, a space opened and he fell in the middle of the empty space.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-45">Still alive and aflame with anger, he rose, and though his blood gushed forth and his wounds were severe he ran through the crowd; and standing upon a steep rock,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-14-46">with his blood now completely drained from him, he tore out his entrails, took them in both hands and hurled them at the crowd, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to give them back to him again. This was the manner of his death.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Maccabees+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Maccabees+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
