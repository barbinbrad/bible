the priest shall assess them according to what each one making a vow can afford.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-9">If it concerns an animal that may be brought as an offering to the Lord, any such that may be given to the Lord shall be holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-10">Another shall not be exchanged or substituted for it, either good for bad or bad for good; and if one animal is substituted for another, both that one and its substitute shall be holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-11">If it concerns any unclean animal that may not be brought as an offering to the Lord, the animal shall be presented before the priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-12">The priest shall assess it: whether good or bad, according to the assessment of the priest, so it shall be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-13">But if it is to be redeemed, one-fifth must be added to the assessment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-14">If a person consecrates a house to the Lord, the priest shall assess it: whether good or bad, as the priest assesses it, so it shall stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-15">And if the one who consecrates the house wishes to redeem it, one-fifth shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original owner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-16">If a person consecrates to the Lord any inherited landholding, its assessment shall be in accordance with its seed requirements: fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-17">If the person consecrates the field as of the year of jubilee, that assessment shall stand;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-18">but if the field is consecrated after the jubilee, the priest shall compute the price for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and the assessment shall be reduced.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-19">And if the one who consecrates the field wishes to redeem it, then one-fifth shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original owner;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-20">but if the field is not redeemed, or if it has been sold to someone else, it shall no longer be redeemable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-21">But when the field is released in the jubilee, it shall be holy to the Lord as a devoted field; it becomes the priest’s holding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-22">If someone consecrates to the Lord a field that has been purchased, which is not a part of the inherited landholding,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-23">the priest shall compute for it the proportionate assessment up to the year of jubilee, and the assessment shall be paid as of that day, a sacred donation to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-24">In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought, whose holding the land is.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-25">All assessments shall be by the sanctuary shekel: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-26">A firstling of animals, however, which as a firstling belongs to the Lord, cannot be consecrated by anyone; whether ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-27">If it is an unclean animal, it shall be ransomed at its assessment, with one-fifth added; if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at its assessment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-28">Nothing that a person owns that has been devoted to destruction for the Lord, be it human or animal, or inherited landholding, may be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-29">No human beings who have been devoted to destruction can be ransomed; they shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-30">All tithes from the land, whether the seed from the ground or the fruit from the tree, are the Lord’s; they are holy to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-31">If persons wish to redeem any of their tithes, they must add one-fifth to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-32">All tithes of herd and flock, every tenth one that passes under the shepherd’s staff, shall be holy to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-33">Let no one inquire whether it is good or bad, or make substitution for it; if one makes substitution for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy and cannot be redeemed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-27-34">These are the commandments that the Lord gave to Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
