And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-5">but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-6">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-7">If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-8">And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-9">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-11">And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-12">when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-13">And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-15">And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and  cattle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-21">And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-23">And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, , God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-4-26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
