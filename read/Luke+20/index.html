I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-15">And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-16">He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-17">But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-18">Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-19">And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-20">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-21">And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person , but of a truth teachest the way of God:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-24">Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-25">And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-26">And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-27">And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-28">and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-29">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-30">and the second:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-31">and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-32">Afterward the woman also died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-33">In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-34">And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-35">but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-36">for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in  the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-38">Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-39">And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-40">For they durst not any more ask him any question.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-41">And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-42">For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-43">Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-44">David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-45">And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-46">Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-47">who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
