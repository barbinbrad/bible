Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-2">By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-3">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-4">Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-5">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-6">We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-7">For whoever has died is freed from sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-8">But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-9">We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-10">The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-11">So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-12">Therefore, do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-13">No longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and present your members to God as instruments of righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-14">For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-15">What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-16">Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-17">But thanks be to God that you, having once been slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-18">and that you, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-19">I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-20">When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-21">So what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed? The end of those things is death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-22">But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the advantage you get is sanctification. The end is eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-6-23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
