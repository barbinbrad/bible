And they went out both of them into the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-12">And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, : when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow,  the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-13">Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-14">And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-15">but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, , And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-18">Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-19">And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-20">And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-21">And, behold, I will send the lad, , Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-22">But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-23">And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-24">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-26">Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-27">And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon,  the second , that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-28">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-29">and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me : and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-30">Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-31">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-33">And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-35">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-36">And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-37">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-38">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-39">But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-40">And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of  toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-20-42">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
