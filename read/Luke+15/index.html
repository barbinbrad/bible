And he divided unto them his living.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-13">And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-14">And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-15">And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-16">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-17">But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-18">I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-19">I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-20">And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-21">And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-22">But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-23">and bring the fatted calf,  kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-24">for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-25">Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-26">And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-27">And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-28">But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-29">But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and  thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-30">but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-31">And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-15-32">But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive ; and  lost, and is found.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
