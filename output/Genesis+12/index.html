Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-5">Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother’s son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-6">Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-7">Then the Lord appeared to Abram, and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-8">From there he moved on to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the Lord and invoked the name of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-9">And Abram journeyed on by stages toward the Negeb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-10">Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to reside there as an alien, for the famine was severe in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-11">When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know well that you are a woman beautiful in appearance;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-12">and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-13">Say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-14">When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-15">When the officials of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-16">And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys, and camels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-17">But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-18">So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-19">Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-12-20">And Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+11"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+13"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
