They shall be recorded under the names of their brothers with regard to their inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-7">For when I came from Paddan, Rachel, alas, died in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-8">When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-9">Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-10">Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see well. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-11">Israel said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see your face; and here God has let me see your children also.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-12">Then Joseph removed them from his father’s knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-13">Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them near him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-14">But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-15">He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-16">the angel who has redeemed me from all harm, bless the boys; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-17">When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-18">Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father! Since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-19">But his father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-20">So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will invoke blessings, saying, ‘God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-21">Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-48-22">I now give to you one portion more than to your brothers, the portion that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+47"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+49"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
