Please tell them to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-9">So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-10">and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and the clusters ripened into grapes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-11">Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-12">Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-13">within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-14">But remember me when it is well with you; please do me the kindness to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-15">For in fact I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-16">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-17">and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-18">And Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-19">within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a pole; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-20">On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-21">He restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-22">but the chief baker he hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-40-23">Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+39"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+41"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
