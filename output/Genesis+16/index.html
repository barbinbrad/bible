She had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-2">and Sarai said to Abram, “You see that the Lord has prevented me from bearing children; go in to my slave-girl; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-3">So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-4">He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-5">Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my slave-girl to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-6">But Abram said to Sarai, “Your slave-girl is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she ran away from her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-7">The angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-8">And he said, “Hagar, slave-girl of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-9">The angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit to her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-10">The angel of the Lord also said to her, “I will so greatly multiply your offspring that they cannot be counted for multitude.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-11">And the angel of the Lord said to her, “Now you have conceived and shall bear a son; you shall call him Ishmael, for the Lord has given heed to your affliction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-12">He shall be a wild ass of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; and he shall live at odds with all his kin.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-13">So she named the Lord who spoke to her, “You are El-roi”; for she said, “Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-14">Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-15">Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-16-16">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+15"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+17"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
