So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-14">Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-15">God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-16">I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-17">Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-18">And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live in your sight!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-19">God said, “No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-20">As for Ishmael, I have heard you; I will bless him and make him fruitful and exceedingly numerous; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-21">But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-22">And when he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-23">Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-24">Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-25">And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-26">That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-17-27">and all the men of his house, slaves born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+16"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+18"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
