Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-12">And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-13">And the Lord stood beside him and said, “I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-14">and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-15">Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-16">Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place—and I did not know it!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-17">And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-18">So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-19">He called that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-20">Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-21">so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-28-22">and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that you give me I will surely give one-tenth to you.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+27"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+29"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
