She was in Chezib when she bore him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-6">Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-7">But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-8">Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her; raise up offspring for your brother.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-9">But since Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, he spilled his semen on the ground whenever he went in to his brother’s wife, so that he would not give offspring to his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-10">What he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord, and he put him to death also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-11">Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”—for he feared that he too would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went to live in her father’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-12">In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua’s daughter, died; when Judah’s time of mourning was over, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-13">When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-14">she put off her widow’s garments, put on a veil, wrapped herself up, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not been given to him in marriage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-15">When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-16">He went over to her at the roadside, and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-17">He answered, “I will send you a kid from the flock.” And she said, “Only if you give me a pledge, until you send it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-18">He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, “Your signet and your cord, and the staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-19">Then she got up and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-20">When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to recover the pledge from the woman, he could not find her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-21">He asked the townspeople, “Where is the temple prostitute who was at Enaim by the wayside?” But they said, “No prostitute has been here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-22">So he returned to Judah, and said, “I have not found her; moreover the townspeople said, ‘No prostitute has been here.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-23">Judah replied, “Let her keep the things as her own, otherwise we will be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-24">About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the whore; moreover she is pregnant as a result of whoredom.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-25">As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “It was the owner of these who made me pregnant.” And she said, “Take note, please, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-26">Then Judah acknowledged them and said, “She is more in the right than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not lie with her again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-27">When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-28">While she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a crimson thread, saying, “This one came out first.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-29">But just then he drew back his hand, and out came his brother; and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore he was named Perez.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-38-30">Afterward his brother came out with the crimson thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+37"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+39"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
