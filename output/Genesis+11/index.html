When Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-11">and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-12">When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-13">and Arpachshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-14">When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-15">and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-16">When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-17">and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-18">When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-19">and Peleg lived after the birth of Reu two hundred nine years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-20">When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-21">and Reu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-22">When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-23">and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-24">When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-25">and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah one hundred nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-26">When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-27">Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-28">Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-29">Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-30">Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-31">Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-11-32">The days of Terah were two hundred five years; and Terah died in Haran.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+10"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+12"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
