But the God of my father has been with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-6">You know that I have served your father with all my strength;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-7">yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-8">If he said, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-9">Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father, and given them to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-10">“During the mating of the flock I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats that leaped upon the flock were striped, speckled, and mottled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-11">Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-12">And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the goats that leap on the flock are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-13">I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and return to the land of your birth.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-14">Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father’s house?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-15">Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-16">All the property that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-17">So Jacob arose, and set his children and his wives on camels;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-18">and he drove away all his livestock, all the property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-19">Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father’s household gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-20">And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-21">So he fled with all that he had; starting out he crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-22">On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-23">So he took his kinsfolk with him and pursued him for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-24">But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, “Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-25">Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsfolk camped in the hill country of Gilead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-26">Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-27">Why did you flee secretly and deceive me and not tell me? I would have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-28">And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? What you have done is foolish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-29">It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-30">Even though you had to go because you longed greatly for your father’s house, why did you steal my gods?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-31">Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-32">But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsfolk, point out what I have that is yours, and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-33">So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered Rachel’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-34">Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt all about in the tent, but did not find them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-35">And she said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.” So he searched, but did not find the household gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-36">Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban. Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-37">Although you have felt about through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsfolk and your kinsfolk, so that they may decide between us two.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-38">These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-39">That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-40">It was like this with me: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-41">These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-43">Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about their children whom they have borne?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-44">Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-45">So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-46">And Jacob said to his kinsfolk, “Gather stones,” and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-47">Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-48">Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore he called it Galeed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-49">and the pillar Mizpah, for he said, “The Lord watch between you and me, when we are absent one from the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-50">If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, though no one else is with us, remember that God is witness between you and me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-51">Then Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap and see the pillar, which I have set between you and me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-52">This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-53">May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor”—the God of their father—“judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-54">and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the height and called his kinsfolk to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night in the hill country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-31-55">Early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them; then he departed and returned home.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+30"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+32"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
