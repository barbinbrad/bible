At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-8">Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-9">Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-10">Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the Lord had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-11">So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-12">Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-13">Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-14">The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-15">for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-16">I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-17">Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-13-18">So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+12"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+14"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
