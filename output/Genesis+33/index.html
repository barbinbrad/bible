So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-2">He put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-3">He himself went on ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-4">But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-5">When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-6">Then the maids drew near, they and their children, and bowed down;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-7">Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down; and finally Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-8">Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company that I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favor with my lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-9">But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-10">Jacob said, “No, please; if I find favor with you, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God—since you have received me with such favor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-11">Please accept my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I want.” So he urged him, and he took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-12">Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go alongside you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-13">But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; and if they are overdriven for one day, all the flocks will die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-14">Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-15">So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Why should my lord be so kind to me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-16">So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-17">But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore the place is called Succoth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-18">Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-19">And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, he bought for one hundred pieces of money the plot of land on which he had pitched his tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-33-20">There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="next" href="../Genesis+32"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+34"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></body></html>
