And he sent and seized many of the men who had deserted to him, and some of the people, and killed them and threw them into a great pit.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-20">He placed Alcimus in charge of the country and left with him a force to help him; then Bacchides went back to the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-21">Alcimus struggled to maintain his high priesthood,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-22">and all who were troubling their people joined him. They gained control of the land of Judah and did great damage in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-23">And Judas saw all the wrongs that Alcimus and those with him had done among the Israelites; it was more than the Gentiles had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-24">So Judas went out into all the surrounding parts of Judea, taking vengeance on those who had deserted and preventing those in the city from going out into the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-25">When Alcimus saw that Judas and those with him had grown strong, and realized that he could not withstand them, he returned to the king and brought malicious charges against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-26">Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honored princes, who hated and detested Israel, and he commanded him to destroy the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-27">So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force, and treacherously sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-28">“Let there be no fighting between you and me; I shall come with a few men to see you face to face in peace.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-29">So he came to Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably; but the enemy were preparing to kidnap Judas.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-30">It became known to Judas that Nicanor had come to him with treacherous intent, and he was afraid of him and would not meet him again.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-31">When Nicanor learned that his plan had been disclosed, he went out to meet Judas in battle near Caphar-salama.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-32">About five hundred of the army of Nicanor fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-33">After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests from the sanctuary and some of the elders of the people came out to greet him peaceably and to show him the burnt offering that was being offered for the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-34">But he mocked them and derided them and defiled them and spoke arrogantly,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-35">and in anger he swore this oath, “Unless Judas and his army are delivered into my hands this time, then if I return safely I will burn up this house.” And he went out in great anger.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-36">At this the priests went in and stood before the altar and the temple; they wept and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-37">“You chose this house to be called by your name, and to be for your people a house of prayer and supplication.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-38">Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their blasphemies, and let them live no longer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-39">Now Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-horon, and the Syrian army joined him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-40">Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men. Then Judas prayed and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-41">“When the messengers from the king spoke blasphemy, your angel went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-42">So also crush this army before us today; let the rest learn that Nicanor has spoken wickedly against the sanctuary, and judge him according to this wickedness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-43">So the armies met in battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. The army of Nicanor was crushed, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-44">When his army saw that Nicanor had fallen, they threw down their arms and fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-45">The Jews pursued them a day’s journey, from Adasa as far as Gazara, and as they followed they kept sounding the battle call on the trumpets.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-46">People came out of all the surrounding villages of Judea, and they outflanked the enemy and drove them back to their pursuers, so that they all fell by the sword; not even one of them was left.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-47">Then the Jews seized the spoils and the plunder; they cut off Nicanor’s head and the right hand that he had so arrogantly stretched out, and brought them and displayed them just outside Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-48">The people rejoiced greatly and celebrated that day as a day of great gladness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-49">They decreed that this day should be celebrated each year on the thirteenth day of Adar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-7-50">So the land of Judah had rest for a few days.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
