Take my place and my brother’s, and go out and fight for our nation, and may the help that comes from Heaven be with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-4">So John chose out of the country twenty thousand warriors and cavalry, and they marched against Cendebeus and camped for the night in Modein.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-5">Early in the morning they started out and marched into the plain, where a large force of infantry and cavalry was coming to meet them; and a stream lay between them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-6">Then he and his army lined up against them. He saw that the soldiers were afraid to cross the stream, so he crossed over first; and when his troops saw him, they crossed over after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-7">Then he divided the army and placed the cavalry in the center of the infantry, for the cavalry of the enemy were very numerous.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-8">They sounded the trumpets, and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight; many of them fell wounded and the rest fled into the stronghold.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-9">At that time Judas the brother of John was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebeus reached Kedron, which he had built.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-10">They also fled into the towers that were in the fields of Azotus, and John burned it with fire, and about two thousand of them fell. He then returned to Judea safely.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-11">Now Ptolemy son of Abubus had been appointed governor over the plain of Jericho; he had a large store of silver and gold,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-12">for he was son-in-law of the high priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-13">His heart was lifted up; he determined to get control of the country, and made treacherous plans against Simon and his sons, to do away with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-14">Now Simon was visiting the towns of the country and attending to their needs, and he went down to Jericho with his sons Mattathias and Judas, in the one hundred seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-15">The son of Abubus received them treacherously in the little stronghold called Dok, which he had built; he gave them a great banquet, and hid men there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-16">When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolemy and his men rose up, took their weapons, rushed in against Simon in the banquet hall and killed him and his two sons, as well as some of his servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-17">So he committed an act of great treachery and returned evil for good.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-18">Then Ptolemy wrote a report about these things and sent it to the king, asking him to send troops to aid him and to turn over to him the towns and the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-19">He sent other troops to Gazara to do away with John; he sent letters to the captains asking them to come to him so that he might give them silver and gold and gifts;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-20">and he sent other troops to take possession of Jerusalem and the temple hill.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-21">But someone ran ahead and reported to John at Gazara that his father and brothers had perished, and that “he has sent men to kill you also.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-22">When he heard this, he was greatly shocked; he seized the men who came to destroy him and killed them, for he had found out that they were seeking to destroy him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-23">The rest of the acts of John and his wars and the brave deeds that he did, and the building of the walls that he completed, and his achievements,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-16-24">are written in the annals of his high priesthood, from the time that he became high priest after his father.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Maccabees+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
