And he was transfigured before them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-3">and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no one on earth could bleach them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-4">And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-5">Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-6">He did not know what to say, for they were terrified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-7">Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a voice, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-8">Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-9">As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-10">So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead could mean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-11">Then they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-12">He said to them, “Elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man, that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-13">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written about him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-14">When they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some scribes arguing with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-15">When the whole crowd saw him, they were immediately overcome with awe, and they ran forward to greet him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-16">He asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-17">Someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-18">and whenever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-19">He answered them, “You faithless generation, how much longer must I be among you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-20">And they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-21">Jesus asked the father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-22">It has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-23">Jesus said to him, “If you are able!—All things can be done for the one who believes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-24">Immediately the father of the child cried out, “I believe; help my unbelief!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-25">When Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-26">After crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he was able to stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-28">When he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-29">He said to them, “This kind can come out only through prayer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-30">They went on from there and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-31">for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands, and they will kill him, and three days after being killed, he will rise again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-32">But they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-33">Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-34">But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-35">He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-36">Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms, he said to them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-37">“Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-38">John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-39">But Jesus said, “Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-40">Whoever is not against us is for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-41">For truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-42">“If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-43">If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-44">And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-45">And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-46">where their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-47">“For everyone will be salted with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-48">Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness, how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
