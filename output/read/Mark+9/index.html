And he said, From a child.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-22">And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-23">And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-24">Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-25">And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-26">And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and  became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-27">But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-28">And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately,  that we could not cast it out?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-29">And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-30">And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-31">For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-32">But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-33">And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-34">But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who  the greatest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-35">And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-36">And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-37">Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-38">John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-39">But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-40">For he that is not against us is for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-41">For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christâ€™s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-42">And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-43">And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-44">And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-45">And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-46">where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-47">For every one shall be salted with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-9-48">Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
