Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looms out of the north, and great destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-2">I have likened daughter Zion to the loveliest pasture.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her. They shall pitch their tents around her; they shall pasture, all in their places.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-4">“Prepare war against her; up, and let us attack at noon!” “Woe to us, for the day declines, the shadows of evening lengthen!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-5">“Up, and let us attack by night, and destroy her palaces!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-6">For thus says the Lord of hosts: Cut down her trees; cast up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-7">As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her wickedness; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-8">Take warning, O Jerusalem, or I shall turn from you in disgust, and make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-9">Thus says the Lord of hosts: Glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer, pass your hand again over its branches.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-10">To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? See, their ears are closed, they cannot listen. The word of the Lord is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-11">But I am full of the wrath of the Lord; I am weary of holding it in. Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the gatherings of young men as well; both husband and wife shall be taken, the old folk and the very aged.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-12">Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-13">For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-14">They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-15">They acted shamefully, they committed abomination; yet they were not ashamed, they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-16">Thus says the Lord: Stand at the crossroads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way lies; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, “We will not walk in it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-17">Also I raised up sentinels for you: “Give heed to the sound of the trumpet!” But they said, “We will not give heed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-18">Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-19">Hear, O earth; I am going to bring disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not given heed to my words; and as for my teaching, they have rejected it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-20">Of what use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-21">Therefore thus says the Lord: See, I am laying before this people stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble; parents and children together, neighbor and friend shall perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-22">Thus says the Lord: See, a people is coming from the land of the north, a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-23">They grasp the bow and the javelin, they are cruel and have no mercy, their sound is like the roaring sea; they ride on horses, equipped like a warrior for battle, against you, O daughter Zion!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-24">“We have heard news of them, our hands fall helpless; anguish has taken hold of us, pain as of a woman in labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-25">Do not go out into the field, or walk on the road; for the enemy has a sword, terror is on every side.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-26">O my poor people, put on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only child, most bitter lamentation: for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-27">I have made you a tester and a refiner among my people so that you may know and test their ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-28">They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about with slanders; they are bronze and iron, all of them act corruptly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-29">The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-6-30">They are called “rejected silver,” for the Lord has rejected them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
