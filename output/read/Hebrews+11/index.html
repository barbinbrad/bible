Through this he received approval as righteous, God himself giving approval to his gifts; he died, but through his faith he still speaks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-5">By faith Enoch was taken so that he did not experience death; and “he was not found, because God had taken him.” For it was attested before he was taken away that “he had pleased God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-6">And without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-7">By faith Noah, warned by God about events as yet unseen, respected the warning and built an ark to save his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-8">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-9">By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-10">For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-11">By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old—and Sarah herself was barren—because he considered him faithful who had promised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-12">Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, “as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-13">All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-14">for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-15">If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-16">But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-17">By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac. He who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-18">of whom he had been told, “It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-19">He considered the fact that God is able even to raise someone from the dead—and figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-20">By faith Isaac invoked blessings for the future on Jacob and Esau.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-21">By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, “bowing in worship over the top of his staff.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-22">By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his burial.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-23">By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that the child was beautiful; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-24">By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh’s daughter,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-25">choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-26">He considered abuse suffered for the Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to the reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-27">By faith he left Egypt, unafraid of the king’s anger; for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-29">By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-31">By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-32">And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-33">who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-34">quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-35">Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-36">Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-37">They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented—&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-38">of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-39">Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-11-40">since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from us, be made perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
