He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-10">By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-11">And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-12">but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-13">henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-15">And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-16">This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; ,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-17">And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-20">by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-21">and  a great priest over the house of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-22">let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-23">let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-24">and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting ; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-28">A man that hath set at nought Mosesâ€™ law dieth without compassion on  two or three witnesses:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-29">of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-30">For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-33">partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-34">For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-35">Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-36">For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-37">For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-38">But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-10-39">But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
