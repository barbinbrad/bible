And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-4">And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-5">But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-6">But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-7">And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-9">And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-11">And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-12">And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-13">And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-14">and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-15">no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-17">But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:—&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-18">one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-19">And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-20">but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-21">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-22">But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-23">And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-24">And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-25">And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-26">And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-27">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-28">For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-29">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-30">For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-31">And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-32">And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-33">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-34">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-35">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-36">and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-37">And there was also a superscription over him, This is the King of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-38">And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-39">But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-40">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-41">And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-42">And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-43">And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-44">the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-45">And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-46">And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-47">And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-48">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-49">And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-50">(he had not consented to their counsel and deed),  of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-51">this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-52">And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-53">And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-54">And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-23-55">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment. &nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
