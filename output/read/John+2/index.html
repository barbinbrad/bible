And they filled them up to the brim.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-9">And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-10">and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when  have drunk freely,  that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-11">This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and  brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-13">And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-14">And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-15">and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-16">and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-17">His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-18">The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-21">But he spake of the temple of his body.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-24">But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-25">and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
