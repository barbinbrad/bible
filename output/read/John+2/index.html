My hour has not yet come.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-5">His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-6">Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-7">Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-8">He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.” So they took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-9">When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-10">and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-11">Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-12">After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they remained there a few days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-13">The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-14">In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-15">Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-16">He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-17">His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-18">The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-19">Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-20">The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-21">But he was speaking of the temple of his body.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-22">After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-23">When he was in Jerusalem during the Passover festival, many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-24">But Jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people&nbsp;</span><span id="John-2-25">and needed no one to testify about anyone; for he himself knew what was in everyone.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
