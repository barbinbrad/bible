Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-9">They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know: that they may be put to shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-10">Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-11">Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be put to shame together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-12">The smith  an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-13">The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and shapeth it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-14">He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the holm-tree and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest: he planteth a fir-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-15">Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-16">He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-17">And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-18">They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-44-19">And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?
