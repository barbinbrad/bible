They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. David and the seer Samuel established them in their office of trust.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-23">So they and their descendants were in charge of the gates of the house of the Lord, that is, the house of the tent, as guards.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-24">The gatekeepers were on the four sides, east, west, north, and south;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-25">and their kindred who were in their villages were obliged to come in every seven days, in turn, to be with them;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-26">for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in charge of the chambers and the treasures of the house of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-27">And they would spend the night near the house of God; for on them lay the duty of watching, and they had charge of opening it every morning.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-28">Some of them had charge of the utensils of service, for they were required to count them when they were brought in and taken out.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-29">Others of them were appointed over the furniture, and over all the holy utensils, also over the choice flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the spices.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-30">Others, of the sons of the priests, prepared the mixing of the spices,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-31">and Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of making the flat cakes.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-32">Also some of their kindred of the Kohathites had charge of the rows of bread, to prepare them for each sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-33">Now these are the singers, the heads of ancestral houses of the Levites, living in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty day and night.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-34">These were heads of ancestral houses of the Levites, according to their generations; these leaders lived in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-35">In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife was Maacah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-36">His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-37">Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-9-38">and Mikloth became the father of Shimeam;
