And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-16">And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him .&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-17">Now on the first  of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-19">And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-20">Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-21">and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-23">And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-24">The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-25">And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-27">And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-28">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-29">But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-33">But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-35">Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee,  will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-39">And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-42">Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-43">And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-44">And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-45">Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-46">Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-49">And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend,  that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-51">And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-52">Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-55">In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-56">But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-57">And they that had taken Jesus led him away to  Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-58">But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-59">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-60">and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-61">and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-62">And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-64">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-65">Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-66">what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-67">Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-68">saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-69">Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another  saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-72">And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-73">And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art  of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-74">Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-26-75">And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
