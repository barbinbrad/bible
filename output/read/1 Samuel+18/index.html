And all the people, even the servants of Saul, approved.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-6">As they were coming home, when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-7">And the women sang to one another as they made merry, “Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-8">Saul was very angry, for this saying displeased him. He said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; what more can he have but the kingdom?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-9">So Saul eyed David from that day on.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-10">The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-11">and Saul threw the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-12">Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-13">So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and David marched out and came in, leading the army.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-14">David had success in all his undertakings; for the Lord was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-15">When Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-16">But all Israel and Judah loved David; for it was he who marched out and came in leading them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-17">Then Saul said to David, “Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the Lord’s battles.” For Saul thought, “I will not raise a hand against him; let the Philistines deal with him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-18">David said to Saul, “Who am I and who are my kinsfolk, my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-19">But at the time when Saul’s daughter Merab should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-20">Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David. Saul was told, and the thing pleased him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-21">Saul thought, “Let me give her to him that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall now be my son-in-law.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-22">Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in private and say, ‘See, the king is delighted with you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the king’s son-in-law.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-23">So Saul’s servants reported these words to David in private. And David said, “Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-24">The servants of Saul told him, “This is what David said.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-25">Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged on the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-26">When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the time had expired,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-27">David rose and went, along with his men, and killed one hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-28">But when Saul realized that the Lord was with David, and that Saul’s daughter Michal loved him,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-29">Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy from that time forward.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-18-30">Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle; and as often as they came out, David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his fame became very great.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
