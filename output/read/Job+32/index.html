Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-7">I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-8">But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-9">It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-11">Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-12">Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-13">Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-14">For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-15">They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-16">And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-17">I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-18">For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-19">Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-21">Let me not, I pray you, respect any manâ€™s person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-32-22">For I know not to give flattering titles;  would my Maker soon take me away.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
