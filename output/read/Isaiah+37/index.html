And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-10">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-11">Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-12">Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-13">Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-14">And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-15">And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-16">O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest  the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-17">Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-18">Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-19">and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-20">Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-21">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-22">this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-23">Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high?  against the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-24">By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-25">I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-26">Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-27">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field  before it is grown up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-28">But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-29">Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-30">And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-31">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-32">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-33">Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-34">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-35">For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-36">And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-37">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-37-38">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
