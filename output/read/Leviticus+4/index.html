Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf, and you shall be forgiven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-4-32">If the offering you bring as a sin offering is a sheep, you shall bring a female without blemish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-4-33">You shall lay your hand on the head of the sin offering; and it shall be slaughtered as a sin offering at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-4-34">The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-4-35">You shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the sheep is removed from the sacrifice of well-being, and the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar, with the offerings by fire to the Lord.
