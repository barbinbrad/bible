and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-3">And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-4">And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-5">And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-6">And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-7">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as menâ€™s faces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-8">And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as  of lions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-9">And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-10">And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-11">They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek  he hath the name Apollyon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-12">The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-13">And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-14">one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-15">And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-16">And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-17">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates  of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-18">By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-19">For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-20">And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-9-21">and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Revelation+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Revelation+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
