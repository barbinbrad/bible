Jesus saith unto them, I am . And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-6">When therefore he said unto them, I am , they went backward, and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-7">Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-8">Jesus answered, I told you that I am ; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-9">that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-10">Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-11">Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-12">So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-13">and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-14">Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and  another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-16">but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-17">The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also  of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-18">Now the servants and the officers were standing , having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-20">Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-21">Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard , what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-22">And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-23">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-24">Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also  of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-26">One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-27">Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-28">They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-29">Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-30">They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-31">Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-32">that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-33">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-34">Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-38">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-39">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-40">They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
