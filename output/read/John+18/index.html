So if you are looking for me, let these men go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-9">This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, “I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-11">Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-12">So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-13">First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-14">Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-15">Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-16">but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-17">The woman said to Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-18">Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-19">Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-20">Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-21">Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-22">When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-23">Jesus answered, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-24">Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-26">One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-27">Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-28">Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate’s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-29">So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-30">They answered, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-31">Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” The Jews replied, “We are not permitted to put anyone to death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-32">(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-33">Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-34">Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-35">Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-36">Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-37">Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-38">Pilate asked him, “What is truth?” After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no case against him. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-39">But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-18-40">They shouted in reply, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a bandit.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
