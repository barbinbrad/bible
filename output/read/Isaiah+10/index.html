To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-4">so as not to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain? For all this his anger has not turned away; his hand is stretched out still.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-5">Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger— the club in their hands is my fury!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-6">Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-7">But this is not what he intends, nor does he have this in mind; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-8">For he says: “Are not my commanders all kings?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-9">Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-10">As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-11">shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols what I have done to Samaria and her images?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-12">When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the arrogant boasting of the king of Assyria and his haughty pride.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-13">For he says: “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and have plundered their treasures; like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-14">My hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing, or opened its mouth, or chirped.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-15">Shall the ax vaunt itself over the one who wields it, or the saw magnify itself against the one who handles it? As if a rod should raise the one who lifts it up, or as if a staff should lift the one who is not wood!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-16">Therefore the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-17">The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-18">The glory of his forest and his fruitful land the Lord will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when an invalid wastes away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-19">The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-20">On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on the one who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-21">A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-22">For though your people Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-23">For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-24">Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: O my people, who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they beat you with a rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-25">For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-26">The Lord of hosts will wield a whip against them, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-27">On that day his burden will be removed from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck. He has gone up from Rimmon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-28">he has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron, at Michmash he stores his baggage;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-29">they have crossed over the pass, at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles, Gibeah of Saul has fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-30">Cry aloud, O daughter Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Answer her, O Anathoth!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-31">Madmenah is in flight, the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-32">This very day he will halt at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mount of daughter Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-33">Look, the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts, will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the tallest trees will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-10-34">He will hack down the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
