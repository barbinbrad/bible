You shall not follow their statutes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-4">My ordinances you shall observe and my statutes you shall keep, following them: I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-5">You shall keep my statutes and my ordinances; by doing so one shall live: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-6">None of you shall approach anyone near of kin to uncover nakedness: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-7">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-8">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is the nakedness of your father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-9">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether born at home or born abroad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-10">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter or of your daughter’s daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-11">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten by your father, since she is your sister.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-12">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-13">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-14">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-15">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law: she is your son’s wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-16">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-17">You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, and you shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are your flesh; it is depravity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-18">And you shall not take a woman as a rival to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-19">You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-20">You shall not have sexual relations with your kinsman’s wife, and defile yourself with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-21">You shall not give any of your offspring to sacrifice them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-22">You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-23">You shall not have sexual relations with any animal and defile yourself with it, nor shall any woman give herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it: it is perversion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-24">Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for by all these practices the nations I am casting out before you have defiled themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-25">Thus the land became defiled; and I punished it for its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-26">But you shall keep my statutes and my ordinances and commit none of these abominations, either the citizen or the alien who resides among you&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-27">(for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled);&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-28">otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-29">For whoever commits any of these abominations shall be cut off from their people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-18-30">So keep my charge not to commit any of these abominations that were done before you, and not to defile yourselves by them: I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
