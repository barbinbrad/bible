Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-2-7">So now send me an artisan skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to join the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-2-8">Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting Lebanon timber.
