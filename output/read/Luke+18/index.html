Will he delay long in helping them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-8">I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-9">He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-10">“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-11">The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-12">I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-13">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-14">I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-15">People were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them; and when the disciples saw it, they sternly ordered them not to do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-16">But Jesus called for them and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-17">Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-18">A certain ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-19">Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-20">You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-21">He replied, “I have kept all these since my youth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-22">When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-23">But when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-24">Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-25">Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-26">Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-27">He replied, “What is impossible for mortals is possible for God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-28">Then Peter said, “Look, we have left our homes and followed you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-29">And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-30">who will not get back very much more in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-31">Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-32">For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-33">After they have flogged him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-34">But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact, what he said was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-35">As he approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-36">When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-37">They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-38">Then he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-39">Those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet; but he shouted even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-40">Jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him; and when he came near, he asked him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-41">“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me see again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-42">Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-18-43">Immediately he regained his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, praised God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
