and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-31">Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-32">And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-33">And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-34">And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-35">And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-15-36">And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones;
