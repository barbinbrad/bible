A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-11">and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-12">and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-13">and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-14">And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-15">And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-16">And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-17">And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-18">And the  two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-19">And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-20">And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-21">And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-22">And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-23">and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-24">And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet,  twined .&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-25">And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-26">a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-27">And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-28">and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-29">and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-30">And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, Holy to Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-31">And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-32">Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-33">And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-34">and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-35">the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-36">the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-37">the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-38">and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-39">the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-40">the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-41">the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-42">According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-39-43">And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it;
