tell of all his wonderful works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-3">Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-4">Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his presence continually.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-5">Remember the wonderful works he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he has uttered,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-6">O offspring of his servant Abraham, children of Jacob, his chosen ones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-7">He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-8">He is mindful of his covenant forever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-9">the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-10">which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-11">saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-12">When they were few in number, of little account, and strangers in it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-13">wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-14">he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-15">saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-16">When he summoned famine against the land, and broke every staff of bread,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-17">he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-18">His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-19">until what he had said came to pass, the word of the Lord kept testing him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-20">The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-21">He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-22">to instruct his officials at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-23">Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-24">And the Lord made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-25">whose hearts he then turned to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-26">He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-27">They performed his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-28">He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled against his words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-29">He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-30">Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-31">He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-32">He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-33">He struck their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-34">He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-35">they devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-36">He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the first issue of all their strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-37">Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold, and there was no one among their tribes who stumbled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-38">Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-39">He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-40">They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them food from heaven in abundance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-41">He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-42">For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-43">So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-44">He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the wealth of the peoples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-105-45">that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws.
