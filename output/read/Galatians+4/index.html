Father!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-7">So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-8">Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-9">Now, however, that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? How can you want to be enslaved to them again?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-10">You are observing special days, and months, and seasons, and years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-11">I am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-12">Friends, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-13">You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I first announced the gospel to you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-14">though my condition put you to the test, you did not scorn or despise me, but welcomed me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-15">What has become of the goodwill you felt? For I testify that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-16">Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-17">They make much of you, but for no good purpose; they want to exclude you, so that you may make much of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-18">It is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times, and not only when I am present with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-19">My little children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-20">I wish I were present with you now and could change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-21">Tell me, you who desire to be subject to the law, will you not listen to the law?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-23">One, the child of the slave, was born according to the flesh; the other, the child of the free woman, was born through the promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-24">Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One woman, in fact, is Hagar, from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-25">Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-26">But the other woman corresponds to the Jerusalem above; she is free, and she is our mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-27">For it is written, “Rejoice, you childless one, you who bear no children, burst into song and shout, you who endure no birth pangs; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-28">Now you, my friends, are children of the promise, like Isaac.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-29">But just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-30">But what does the scripture say? “Drive out the slave and her child; for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-4-31">So then, friends, we are children, not of the slave but of the free woman.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Galatians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
