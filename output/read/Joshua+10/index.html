Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. &nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-14">And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-15">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-16">And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-17">And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-18">And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-19">but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-20">And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-21">that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-22">Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-23">And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-24">And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-25">And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-26">And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-27">And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-28">And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-29">And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-30">and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-31">And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-32">and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-33">Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-34">And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-35">and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-36">And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-37">and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-38">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-39">and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-40">So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-41">And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-42">And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-10-43">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Joshua+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
