Throughout your generations he shall perform the atonement for it once a year with the blood of the atoning sin offering. It is most holy to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-11">The Lord spoke to Moses:&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-12">When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, at registration all of them shall give a ransom for their lives to the Lord, so that no plague may come upon them for being registered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-13">This is what each one who is registered shall give: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as an offering to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-14">Each one who is registered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the Lord’s offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-15">The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when you bring this offering to the Lord to make atonement for your lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-16">You shall take the atonement money from the Israelites and shall designate it for the service of the tent of meeting; before the Lord it will be a reminder to the Israelites of the ransom given for your lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-17">The Lord spoke to Moses:&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-18">You shall make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-19">with the water Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-20">When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to make an offering by fire to the Lord, they shall wash with water, so that they may not die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-21">They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die: it shall be a perpetual ordinance for them, for him and for his descendants throughout their generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-22">The Lord spoke to Moses:&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-23">Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, two hundred fifty, and two hundred fifty of aromatic cane,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-24">and five hundred of cassia—measured by the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-25">and you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-26">With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the covenant,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-27">and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-28">and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-29">you shall consecrate them, so that they may be most holy; whatever touches them will become holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-30">You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, in order that they may serve me as priests.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-31">You shall say to the Israelites, “This shall be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-32">It shall not be used in any ordinary anointing of the body, and you shall make no other like it in composition; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-33">Whoever compounds any like it or whoever puts any of it on an unqualified person shall be cut off from the people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-34">The Lord said to Moses: Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense (an equal part of each),&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-35">and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-36">and you shall beat some of it into powder, and put part of it before the covenant in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with you; it shall be for you most holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-37">When you make incense according to this composition, you shall not make it for yourselves; it shall be regarded by you as holy to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-30-38">Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume shall be cut off from the people.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+29/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
