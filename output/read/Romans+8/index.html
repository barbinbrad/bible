But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-10">And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-11">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-12">So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-13">for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-15">For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-16">The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-17">and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with , that we may be also glorified with .&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-19">For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-20">For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-21">that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-22">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-23">And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for  adoption, , the redemption of our body.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-24">For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-25">But if we hope for that which we see not,  do we with patience wait for it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-26">And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for  with groanings which cannot be uttered;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-27">and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to  God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-28">And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good,  to them that are called according to  purpose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-29">For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-30">and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-31">What then shall we say to these things? If God  for us, who  against us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-32">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-33">Who shall lay anything to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? It is God that justifieth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-34">who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-36">Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-37">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-8-39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
