For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-6">Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-7">The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-8">And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-9">So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-10">The Israelites set out, and camped in Oboth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-11">They set out from Oboth, and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness bordering Moab toward the sunrise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-12">From there they set out, and camped in the Wadi Zered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-13">From there they set out, and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-14">Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord, “Waheb in Suphah and the wadis. The Arnon &nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-15">and the slopes of the wadis that extend to the seat of Ar, and lie along the border of Moab.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-16">From there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-17">Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well!—Sing to it!—&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-18">the well that the leaders sank, that the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, with the staff.” From the wilderness to Mattanah, &nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-19">from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-20">and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that overlooks the wasteland.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-21">Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-22">“Let me pass through your land; we will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of any well; we will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-23">But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness; he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-24">Israel put him to the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites; for the boundary of the Ammonites was strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-25">Israel took all these towns, and Israel settled in all the towns of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-26">For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and captured all his land as far as the Arnon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-27">Therefore the ballad singers say, “Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-28">For fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, and swallowed up the heights of the Arnon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-29">Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-30">So their posterity perished from Heshbon to Dibon, and we laid waste until fire spread to Medeba.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-31">Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-32">Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they captured its villages, and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-33">Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan; and King Og of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-34">But the Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him; for I have given him into your hand, with all his people, and all his land. You shall do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-21-35">So they killed him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
