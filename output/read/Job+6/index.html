Or loweth the ox over his fodder?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-6">Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-7">My soul refuseth to touch ; They are as loathsome food to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-8">Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant  the thing that I long for!&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-9">Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-10">And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-11">What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-12">Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-13">Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-14">To him that is ready to faint kindness  from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-16">Which are black by reason of the ice,  wherein the snow hideth itself:&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-17">What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-18">The caravans  by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-19">The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-20">They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-21">For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-22">Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-23">Or, Deliver me from the adversaryâ€™s hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-24">Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-25">How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-26">Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-27">Yea, ye would cast  upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-28">Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-29">Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-6-30">Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
