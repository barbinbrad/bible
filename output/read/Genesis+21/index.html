And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-17">And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-18">Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-19">And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-20">And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-21">And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-22">And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-23">now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-24">And Abraham said, I will swear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-25">And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-26">And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-28">And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-29">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-30">And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-31">Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-32">So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-33">And  planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-21-34">And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
