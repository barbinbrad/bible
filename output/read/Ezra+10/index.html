So they sware.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-6">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and  he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-7">And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-8">and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-9">Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days (it was the ninth month, on the twentieth  of the month); and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-10">And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-11">Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-12">Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-13">But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-14">Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-15">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this : and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezra-10-16">And the children of the captivity did so.
