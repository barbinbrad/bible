They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-2">Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “You say so.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-3">Then the chief priests accused him of many things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-4">Pilate asked him again, “Have you no answer? See how many charges they bring against you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-5">But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-6">Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for whom they asked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-7">Now a man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-8">So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-9">Then he answered them, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-10">For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-12">Pilate spoke to them again, “Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-13">They shouted back, “Crucify him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-14">Pilate asked them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-15">So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-16">Then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor’s headquarters); and they called together the whole cohort.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-17">And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-18">And they began saluting him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-19">They struck his head with a reed, spat upon him, and knelt down in homage to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-20">After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-21">They compelled a passer-by, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross; it was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-22">Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-23">And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-24">And they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots to decide what each should take.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-25">It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-26">The inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-27">And with him they crucified two bandits, one on his right and one on his left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-28">Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-29">save yourself, and come down from the cross!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-30">In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-31">Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-32">When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-33">At three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-34">When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “Listen, he is calling for Elijah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-35">And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-36">Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-37">And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-38">Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-39">There were also women looking on from a distance; among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-40">These used to follow him and provided for him when he was in Galilee; and there were many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-41">When evening had come, and since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-42">Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-43">Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-44">When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-45">Then Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-15-46">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was laid.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
