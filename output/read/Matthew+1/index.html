And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, &nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-7">and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-8">and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-9">and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-10">and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-11">and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-12">And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, and Salathiel the father of Zerubbabel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-13">and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-14">and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-15">and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-16">and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-1-18">Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way.
