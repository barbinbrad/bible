And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-3">and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down , in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-4">that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-5">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-6">And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-7">Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-8">And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-9">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-10">And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-11">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-12">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-13">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-17">And he said, What is the thing that  hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-19">And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-3-21">And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
