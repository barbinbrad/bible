But what are they among so many people?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-10">Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand in all.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-11">Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-12">When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing may be lost.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-13">So they gathered them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-14">When the people saw the sign that he had done, they began to say, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-15">When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-16">When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-17">got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-18">The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-19">When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were terrified.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-20">But he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-21">Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-22">The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there. They also saw that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-23">Then some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-24">So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-25">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-26">Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-27">Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-28">Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-29">Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-30">So they said to him, “What sign are you going to give us then, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-31">Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-32">Then Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-33">For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-34">They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-35">Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-36">But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-37">Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-38">for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-39">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-40">This is indeed the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-41">Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-42">They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-43">Jesus answered them, “Do not complain among yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-44">No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-45">It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-46">Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-47">Very truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-48">I am the bread of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-49">Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-50">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-51">I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-52">The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-53">So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-54">Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-55">for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-56">Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-57">Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-58">This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-59">He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-60">When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-61">But Jesus, being aware that his disciples were complaining about it, said to them, “Does this offend you?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-62">Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-63">It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-64">But among you there are some who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe, and who was the one that would betray him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-65">And he said, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-66">Because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-67">So Jesus asked the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-68">Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-69">We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-70">Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-6-71">He was speaking of Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for he, though one of the twelve, was going to betray him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
