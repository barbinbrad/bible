God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom  father chasteneth not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-8">But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-9">Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-10">For they indeed for a few days chastened  as seemed good to them; but he for  profit, that  may be partakers of his holiness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-11">All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby,  of righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-12">Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-13">and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-14">Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-15">looking carefully lest  any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble , and thereby the many be defiled;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-16">lest  any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-17">For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind , though he sought it diligently with tears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-18">For ye are not come unto  that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-19">and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which  they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-20">for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-21">and so fearful was the appearance,  Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-22">but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-23">to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-24">and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than  Abel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-25">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned  on earth, much more  we  who turn away from him that  from heaven:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-26">whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-27">And this , Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-28">Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:&nbsp;</span><span id="Heb-12-29">for our God is a consuming fire.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hebrews+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
