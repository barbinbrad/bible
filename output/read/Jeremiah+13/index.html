shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-22">And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-23">Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-24">Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-25">This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-26">Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-13-27">I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field.
