that as  the readiness to will, so  the completion also out of your ability.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-12">For if the readiness is there,  acceptable according as  hath, not according as  hath not.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-13">For  not  that others may be eased  ye distressed;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-14">but by equality: your abundance  at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become  for your want; that there may be equality:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-15">as it is written, He that  much had nothing over; and he that  little had no lack.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-16">But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-17">For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-18">And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel  through all the churches;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-19">and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in  this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and  our readiness:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-20">avoiding this, that any man should blame us in  this bounty which is ministered by us:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-21">for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-22">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which  in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-23">Whether  about Titus,  my partner and  fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren,  the messengers of the churches,  the glory of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-8-24">Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Corinthians+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
