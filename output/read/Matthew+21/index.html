And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-17">And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-18">Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-19">And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-20">And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-21">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-22">And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-23">And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-24">And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-25">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-26">But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-27">And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-28">But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-29">And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-30">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I , sir: and went not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-31">Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-32">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-33">Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-34">And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-35">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-36">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-37">But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-38">But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-39">And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-40">When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-41">They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-42">Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is marvellous in our eyes?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-43">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-44">And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-45">And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-21-46">And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
