and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-4">And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-5">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-6">An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-7">Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near,  tumult, and not  joyful shouting, upon the mountains.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-8">Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-9">And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-10">Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-11">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them , nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-12">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-14">They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-15">The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-16">But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-18">They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations  their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-21">And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret ; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-23">Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-24">Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-25">Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-7-27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
