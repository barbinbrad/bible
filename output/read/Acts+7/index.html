The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-3">and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-4">Then he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God had him move from there to this country in which you are now living.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-5">He did not give him any of it as a heritage, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-6">And God spoke in these terms, that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others, who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-7">‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-8">Then he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-9">“The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-10">and rescued him from all his afflictions, and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-11">Now there came a famine throughout Egypt and Canaan, and great suffering, and our ancestors could find no food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-12">But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there on their first visit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-13">On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-14">Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five in all;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-15">so Jacob went down to Egypt. He himself died there as well as our ancestors,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-16">and their bodies were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-17">“But as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, our people in Egypt increased and multiplied&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-18">until another king who had not known Joseph ruled over Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-19">He dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-20">At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful before God. For three months he was brought up in his father’s house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-21">and when he was abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-22">So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-23">“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his relatives, the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-24">When he saw one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-25">He supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that God through him was rescuing them, but they did not understand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-26">The next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-27">But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-28">Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-29">When he heard this, Moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-30">“Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-31">When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight; and as he approached to look, there came the voice of the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-32">‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-33">Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-34">I have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come now, I will send you to Egypt.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-35">“It was this Moses whom they rejected when they said, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ and whom God now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-36">He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-37">This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-38">He is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living oracles to give to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-39">Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him; instead, they pushed him aside, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-40">saying to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will lead the way for us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-41">At that time they made a calf, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and reveled in the works of their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-42">But God turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: ‘Did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-43">No; you took along the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; so I will remove you beyond Babylon.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-44">“Our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness, as God directed when he spoke to Moses, ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-45">Our ancestors in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors. And it was there until the time of David,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-46">who found favor with God and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-47">But it was Solomon who built a house for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-48">Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with human hands; as the prophet says,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-49">‘Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-50">Did not my hand make all these things?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-51">“You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-52">Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-53">You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-54">When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-55">But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-56">“Look,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-57">But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-58">Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-59">While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-7-60">Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
