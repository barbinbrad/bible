thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-1-51">And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-1-52">And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-1-53">But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-1-54">Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5"
