You received without payment; give without payment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-9">Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-10">no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-11">Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-12">As you enter the house, greet it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-13">If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-14">If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-15">Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-16">“See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-17">Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-18">and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-19">When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-20">for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-21">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-22">and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-23">When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-24">“A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above the master;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-25">it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-26">“So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-27">What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-28">Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-29">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-30">And even the hairs of your head are all counted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-31">So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-32">“Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-33">but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-34">“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-35">For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-36">and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-37">Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-38">and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-39">Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-40">“Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-41">Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-10-42">and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple—truly I tell you, none of these will lose their reward.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
