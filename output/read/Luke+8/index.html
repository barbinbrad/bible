As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-9">And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-10">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-11">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-12">And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-13">And those on the rock  they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-14">And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of  life, and bring no fruit to perfection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-15">And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-16">And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-17">For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor  secret, that shall not be known and come to light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-18">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-19">And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-20">And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-21">But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-22">Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-23">But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling , and were in jeopardy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-24">And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-25">And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-26">And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-27">And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in  house, but in the tombs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-28">And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-29">For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-30">And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-31">And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-32">Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-33">And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-34">And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-35">And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-36">And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-37">And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-38">But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-39">Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-40">And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-41">And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-42">for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-43">And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-44">came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-45">And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush .&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-46">But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-47">And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-48">And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-49">While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s , saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-50">But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-51">And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-52">And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-53">And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-54">But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-55">And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that  be given her to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-8-56">And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
