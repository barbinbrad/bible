When they heard of it, the men were indignant and very angry, because he had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-8">But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The heart of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-9">Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-10">You shall live with us; and the land shall be open to you; live and trade in it, and get property in it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-11">Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor with you, and whatever you say to me I will give.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-12">Put the marriage present and gift as high as you like, and I will give whatever you ask me; only give me the girl to be my wife.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-13">The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-14">They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-15">Only on this condition will we consent to you: that you will become as we are and every male among you be circumcised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-16">Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-17">But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-18">Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-19">And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his family.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-20">So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-21">“These people are friendly with us; let them live in the land and trade in it, for the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them our daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-22">Only on this condition will they agree to live among us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-23">Will not their livestock, their property, and all their animals be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live among us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-24">And all who went out of the city gate heeded Hamor and his son Shechem; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-25">On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and came against the city unawares, and killed all the males.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-26">They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-27">And the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-28">They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-29">All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and made their prey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-30">Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-34-31">But they said, “Should our sister be treated like a whore?”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
