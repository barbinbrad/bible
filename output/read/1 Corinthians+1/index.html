Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-14">I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-15">so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-16">(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-17">For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-18">For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-19">For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-20">Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-22">For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-23">but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-24">but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-25">For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-26">Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-27">But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-28">God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-29">so that no one might boast in the presence of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-30">He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-1-31">in order that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
