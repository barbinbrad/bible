My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in my victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-2">“There is no Holy One like the Lord, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-3">Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-4">The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-5">Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-6">The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-7">The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-8">He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and on them he has set the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-9">“He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-10">The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-11">Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, while the boy remained to minister to the Lord, in the presence of the priest Eli.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-12">Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they had no regard for the Lord&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-13">or for the duties of the priests to the people. When anyone offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-14">and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-15">Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-16">And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take whatever you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now; if not, I will take it by force.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-17">Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the Lord; for they treated the offerings of the Lord with contempt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-18">Samuel was ministering before the Lord, a boy wearing a linen ephod.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-19">His mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-20">Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the Lord repay you with children by this woman for the gift that she made to the Lord”; and then they would return to their home.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-21">And the Lord took note of Hannah; she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-22">Now Eli was very old. He heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-23">He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-24">No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear the people of the Lord spreading abroad.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-25">If one person sins against another, someone can intercede for the sinner with the Lord; but if someone sins against the Lord, who can make intercession?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the Lord to kill them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-26">Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the Lord and with the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-27">A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus the Lord has said, ‘I revealed myself to the family of your ancestor in Egypt when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-28">I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to offer incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the family of your ancestor all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-29">Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?’&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-30">Therefore the Lord the God of Israel declares: ‘I promised that your family and the family of your ancestor should go in and out before me forever’; but now the Lord declares: ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be treated with contempt.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-31">See, a time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your ancestor’s family, so that no one in your family will live to old age.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-32">Then in distress you will look with greedy eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed upon Israel; and no one in your family shall ever live to old age.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-33">The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; all the members of your household shall die by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-34">The fate of your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you—both of them shall die on the same day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-35">I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed one forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-2-36">Everyone who is left in your family shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me in one of the priest’s places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
