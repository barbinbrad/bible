and they shall prophesy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-19">And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-20">The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-21">Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-22">“You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know—&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-23">this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-24">But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-25">For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-26">therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-27">For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-28">You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-29">“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-30">Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-31">Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying, ‘He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-32">This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-33">Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you both see and hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-34">For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-35">until I make your enemies your footstool.”’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-36">Therefore let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-37">Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and to the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-38">Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-39">For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-40">And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-41">So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-42">They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-43">Awe came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-44">All who believed were together and had all things in common;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-45">they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-46">Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-2-47">praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
