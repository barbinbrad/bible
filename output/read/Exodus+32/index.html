Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-8">they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-9">The Lord said to Moses, “I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they are.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-10">Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make a great nation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-11">But Moses implored the Lord his God, and said, “O Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-12">Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-14">And the Lord changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-15">Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the covenant in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, written on the front and on the back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-16">The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-17">When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-18">But he said, “It is not the sound made by victors, or the sound made by losers; it is the sound of revelers that I hear.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-19">As soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses’ anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-20">He took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-21">Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-22">And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are bent on evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-23">They said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-24">So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-25">When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them run wild, to the derision of their enemies),&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-26">then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the Lord’s side? Come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-27">He said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-28">The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the people fell on that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-29">Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the Lord, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing on yourselves this day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-30">On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-31">So Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-32">But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-33">But the Lord said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-34">But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes for punishment, I will punish them for their sin.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-32-35">Then the Lord sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf—the one that Aaron made.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
