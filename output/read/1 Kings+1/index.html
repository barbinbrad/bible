She became the king’s attendant and served him, but the king did not know her sexually.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-5">Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-6">His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, “Why have you done thus and so?” He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-7">He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, and they supported Adonijah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-8">But the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the prophet Nathan, and Shimei, and Rei, and David’s own warriors did not side with Adonijah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-9">Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the stone Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-10">but he did not invite the prophet Nathan or Benaiah or the warriors or his brother Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-11">Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know it?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-12">Now therefore come, let me give you advice, so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-13">Go in at once to King David, and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then is Adonijah king?’&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-14">Then while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-15">So Bathsheba went to the king in his room. The king was very old; Abishag the Shunammite was attending the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-16">Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, “What do you wish?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-17">She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-18">But now suddenly Adonijah has become king, though you, my lord the king, do not know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-19">He has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the children of the king, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander of the army; but your servant Solomon he has not invited.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-20">But you, my lord the king—the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-21">Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors, that my son Solomon and I will be counted offenders.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-22">While she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan came in.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-23">The king was told, “Here is the prophet Nathan.” When he came in before the king, he did obeisance to the king, with his face to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-24">Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne’?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-25">For today he has gone down and has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s children, Joab the commander of the army, and the priest Abiathar, who are now eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-26">But he did not invite me, your servant, and the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-27">Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not let your servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-28">King David answered, “Summon Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-29">The king swore, saying, “As the Lord lives, who has saved my life from every adversity,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-30">as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so will I do this day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-31">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-32">King David said, “Summon to me the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-33">the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-34">There let the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-35">You shall go up following him. Let him enter and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-36">Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, so ordain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-37">As the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-38">So the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and led him to Gihon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-39">There the priest Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-40">And all the people went up following him, playing on pipes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth quaked at their noise.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-41">Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is the city in an uproar?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-42">While he was still speaking, Jonathan son of the priest Abiathar arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a worthy man and surely you bring good news.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-43">Jonathan answered Adonijah, “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-44">the king has sent with him the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they had him ride on the king’s mule;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-45">the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you heard.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-46">Solomon now sits on the royal throne.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-47">Moreover the king’s servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.’ The king bowed in worship on the bed&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-48">and went on to pray thus, ‘Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has granted one of my offspring to sit on my throne and permitted me to witness it.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-49">Then all the guests of Adonijah got up trembling and went their own ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-50">Adonijah, fearing Solomon, got up and went to grasp the horns of the altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-51">Solomon was informed, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; see, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-52">So Solomon responded, “If he proves to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-1-53">Then King Solomon sent to have him brought down from the altar. He came to do obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go home.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Kings+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
