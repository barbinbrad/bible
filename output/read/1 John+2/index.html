But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-2">and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-3">Now by this we may be sure that we know him, if we obey his commandments.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-4">Whoever says, “I have come to know him,” but does not obey his commandments, is a liar, and in such a person the truth does not exist;&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-5">but whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has reached perfection. By this we may be sure that we are in him:&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-6">whoever says, “I abide in him,” ought to walk just as he walked.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-7">Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-8">Yet I am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-9">Whoever says, “I am in the light,” while hating a brother or sister, is still in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-10">Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light, and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-11">But whoever hates another believer is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has brought on blindness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-12">I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-13">I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-14">I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-15">Do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world;&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-16">for all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in riches—comes not from the Father but from the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-17">And the world and its desire are passing away, but those who do the will of God live forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-18">Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-19">They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-20">But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-21">I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-22">Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-23">No one who denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the Father also.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-24">Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-25">And this is what he has promised us, eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-26">I write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-27">As for you, the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and so you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-28">And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-2-29">If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 John+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
