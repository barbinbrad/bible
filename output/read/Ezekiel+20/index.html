To consult me? As I live, says the Lord God, I will not be consulted by you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-4">Will you judge them, mortal, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their ancestors,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-5">and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob—making myself known to them in the land of Egypt—I swore to them, saying, I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-6">On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-7">And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-8">But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; not one of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. &nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-9">But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-10">So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-11">I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-12">Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, so that they might know that I the Lord sanctify them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-13">But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not observe my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make an end of them. &nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-14">But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-15">Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-16">because they rejected my ordinances and did not observe my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-17">Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make an end of them in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-18">I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not follow the statutes of your parents, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-19">I the Lord am your God; follow my statutes, and be careful to observe my ordinances,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-20">and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, so that you may know that I the Lord am your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-21">But the children rebelled against me; they did not follow my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance everyone shall live; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. &nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-22">But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-23">Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-24">because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their ancestors’ idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-25">Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-26">I defiled them through their very gifts, in their offering up all their firstborn, in order that I might horrify them, so that they might know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-27">Therefore, mortal, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: In this again your ancestors blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-28">For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-29">(I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So it is called Bamah to this day.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-30">Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your ancestors and go astray after their detestable things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-31">When you offer your gifts and make your children pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be consulted by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord God, I will not be consulted by you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-32">What is in your mind shall never happen—the thought, “Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-33">As I live, says the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-34">I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-35">and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-36">As I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-37">I will make you pass under the staff, and will bring you within the bond of the covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-38">I will purge out the rebels among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they reside as aliens, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-39">As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Go serve your idols, every one of you now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-40">For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord God, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-41">As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-42">You shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-43">There you shall remember your ways and all the deeds by which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-44">And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, or corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-45">The word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-46">Mortal, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-47">say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-48">All flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-20-49">Then I said, “Ah Lord God! they are saying of me, ‘Is he not a maker of allegories?’”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
