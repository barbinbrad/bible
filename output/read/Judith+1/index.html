In those days Arphaxad ruled over the Medes in Ecbatana.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-2">He built walls around Ecbatana with hewn stones three cubits thick and six cubits long; he made the walls seventy cubits high and fifty cubits wide.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-3">At its gates he raised towers one hundred cubits high and sixty cubits wide at the foundations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-4">He made its gates seventy cubits high and forty cubits wide to allow his armies to march out in force and his infantry to form their ranks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-5">Then King Nebuchadnezzar made war against King Arphaxad in the great plain that is on the borders of Ragau.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-6">There rallied to him all the people of the hill country and all those who lived along the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Hydaspes, and, on the plain, Arioch, king of the Elymeans. Thus, many nations joined the forces of the Chaldeans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-7">Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, sent messengers to all who lived in Persia and to all who lived in the west, those who lived in Cilicia and Damascus, Lebanon and Antilebanon, and all who lived along the seacoast,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-8">and those among the nations of Carmel and Gilead, and Upper Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-9">and all who were in Samaria and its towns, and beyond the Jordan as far as Jerusalem and Bethany and Chelous and Kadesh and the river of Egypt, and Tahpanhes and Raamses and the whole land of Goshen,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-10">even beyond Tanis and Memphis, and all who lived in Egypt as far as the borders of Ethiopia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-11">But all who lived in the whole region disregarded the summons of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, and refused to join him in the war; for they were not afraid of him, but regarded him as only one man. So they sent back his messengers empty-handed and in disgrace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-12">Then Nebuchadnezzar became very angry with this whole region, and swore by his throne and kingdom that he would take revenge on the whole territory of Cilicia and Damascus and Syria, that he would kill with his sword also all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the people of Ammon, and all Judea, and every one in Egypt, as far as the coasts of the two seas.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-13">In the seventeenth year he led his forces against King Arphaxad and defeated him in battle, overthrowing the whole army of Arphaxad and all his cavalry and all his chariots.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-14">Thus he took possession of his towns and came to Ecbatana, captured its towers, plundered its markets, and turned its glory into disgrace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-15">He captured Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau and struck him down with his spears, thus destroying him once and for all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-1-16">Then he returned to Nineveh, he and all his combined forces, a vast body of troops; and there he and his forces rested and feasted for one hundred twenty days.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Tobit+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judith+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
