This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-13">When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-14">All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-15">In those days Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-16">“Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus—&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-17">for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-18">(Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-19">This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-20">“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it’; and ‘Let another take his position of overseer.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-21">So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-22">beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us—one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-23">So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-24">Then they prayed and said, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-25">to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-1-26">And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
