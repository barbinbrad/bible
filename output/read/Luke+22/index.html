Make preparations for us there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-13">So they went and found everything as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover meal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-14">When the hour came, he took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-15">He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-16">for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-17">Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-18">for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-19">Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-20">And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-21">But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-22">For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-23">Then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-24">A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-25">But he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-26">But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-27">For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-28">“You are those who have stood by me in my trials;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-29">and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-30">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-31">“Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-32">but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-33">And he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-34">Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-35">He said to them, “When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “No, not a thing.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-36">He said to them, “But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-37">For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was counted among the lawless’; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-38">They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” He replied, “It is enough.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-39">He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-40">When he reached the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-41">Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-42">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-43">[[Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-44">In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.]]&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-45">When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-46">and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-47">While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-48">but Jesus said to him, “Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-49">When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-50">Then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-51">But Jesus said, “No more of this!” And he touched his ear and healed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-53">When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-54">Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-55">When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-56">Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said, “This man also was with him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-57">But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-58">A little later someone else, on seeing him, said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-59">Then about an hour later still another kept insisting, “Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-60">But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-61">The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-62">And he went out and wept bitterly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-63">Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-64">they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-65">They kept heaping many other insults on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-66">When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-67">They said, “If you are the Messiah, tell us.” He replied, “If I tell you, you will not believe;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-68">and if I question you, you will not answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-70">All of them asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-71">Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
