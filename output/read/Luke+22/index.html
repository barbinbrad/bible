is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-28">But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-29">and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-30">that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-31">Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-32">but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-33">And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-34">And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-35">And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-36">And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-37">For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-38">And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-39">And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-40">And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-41">And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-42">saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-43">And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-44">And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-45">And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-46">and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-47">While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-48">But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-49">And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-50">And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-51">But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye  thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-52">And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-53">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-54">And they seized him, and led him , and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-55">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-56">And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light , and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-57">But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-58">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art  of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-59">And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-60">But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-61">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-62">And he went out, and wept bitterly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-63">And the men that held  mocked him, and beat him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-64">And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-65">And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-66">And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-67">If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-68">and if I ask , ye will not answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-69">But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-70">And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-22-71">And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
