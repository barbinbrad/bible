This was their appearance: they were of human form.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-6">Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-7">Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calfâ€™s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-8">Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-9">their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without turning as they moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-10">As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-11">such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-12">Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-13">In the middle of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-14">The living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-15">As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-16">As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-17">When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-18">Their rims were tall and awesome, for the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-19">When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-20">Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-21">When they moved, the others moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-22">Over the heads of the living creatures there was something like a dome, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-23">Under the dome their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-24">When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-25">And there came a voice from above the dome over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-26">And above the dome over their heads there was something like a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was something that seemed like a human form.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-27">Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendor all around.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-1-28">Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendor all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of someone speaking.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Baruch+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
