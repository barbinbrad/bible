And Isaac went to Gerar, to King Abimelech of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-2">The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; settle in the land that I shall show you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-3">Reside in this land as an alien, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will fulfill the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-4">I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and will give to your offspring all these lands; and all the nations of the earth shall gain blessing for themselves through your offspring,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-5">because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-6">So Isaac settled in Gerar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-7">When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister”; for he was afraid to say, “My wife,” thinking, “or else the men of the place might kill me for the sake of Rebekah, because she is attractive in appearance.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-8">When Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw him fondling his wife Rebekah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-9">So Abimelech called for Isaac, and said, “So she is your wife! Why then did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I might die because of her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-10">Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-11">So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife shall be put to death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-12">Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in the same year reaped a hundredfold. The Lord blessed him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-13">and the man became rich; he prospered more and more until he became very wealthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-14">He had possessions of flocks and herds, and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-15">(Now the Philistines had stopped up and filled with earth all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-16">And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-17">So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-18">Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham; for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the names that his father had given them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-19">But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-20">the herders of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herders, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the well Esek, because they contended with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-21">Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also; so he called it Sitnah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-22">He moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-23">From there he went up to Beer-sheba.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-24">And that very night the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham; do not be afraid, for I am with you and will bless you and make your offspring numerous for my servant Abraham’s sake.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-25">So he built an altar there, called on the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac’s servants dug a well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-27">Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-28">They said, “We see plainly that the Lord has been with you; so we say, let there be an oath between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-29">so that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-30">So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-31">In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths; and Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-32">That same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well that they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-33">He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-34">When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-26-35">and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
