And he was speechless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-13">Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-14">For many are called, but few chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in  talk.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-16">And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-19">Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-20">And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-21">They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-22">And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-23">On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-24">saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-26">in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-27">And after them all, the woman died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-28">In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-29">But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not  of the dead, but of the living.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-33">And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-34">But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-35">And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-36">Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-37">And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-38">This is the great and first commandment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-39">And a second like  is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-40">On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-42">saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him,  of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-44">The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-45">If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-22-46">And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
