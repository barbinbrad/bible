Be made clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-4">Then Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-5">When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-6">and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-7">And he said to him, “I will come and cure him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-8">The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant will be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-9">For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and the slave does it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-10">When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-11">I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-12">while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-13">And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.” And the servant was healed in that hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-14">When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-15">he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-16">That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were sick.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-17">This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-18">Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-19">A scribe then approached and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-20">And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-21">Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-22">But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-23">And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-24">A windstorm arose on the sea, so great that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-25">And they went and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-26">And he said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a dead calm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-27">They were amazed, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-28">When he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him. They were so fierce that no one could pass that way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-29">Suddenly they shouted, “What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-30">Now a large herd of swine was feeding at some distance from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-31">The demons begged him, “If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-32">And he said to them, “Go!” So they came out and entered the swine; and suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-33">The swineherds ran off, and on going into the town, they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-8-34">Then the whole town came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
