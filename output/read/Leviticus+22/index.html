Whoever touches anything made unclean by a corpse or a man who has had an emission of semen,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-5">and whoever touches any swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or any human being by whom he may be made unclean—whatever his uncleanness may be—&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-6">the person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the sacred donations unless he has washed his body in water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-7">When the sun sets he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the sacred donations, for they are his food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-8">That which died or was torn by wild animals he shall not eat, becoming unclean by it: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-9">They shall keep my charge, so that they may not incur guilt and die in the sanctuary for having profaned it: I am the Lord; I sanctify them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-10">No lay person shall eat of the sacred donations. No bound or hired servant of the priest shall eat of the sacred donations;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-11">but if a priest acquires anyone by purchase, the person may eat of them; and those that are born in his house may eat of his food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-12">If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the sacred donations;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-13">but if a priest’s daughter is widowed or divorced, without offspring, and returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s food. No lay person shall eat of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-14">If a man eats of the sacred donation unintentionally, he shall add one-fifth of its value to it, and give the sacred donation to the priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-15">No one shall profane the sacred donations of the people of Israel, which they offer to the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-16">causing them to bear guilt requiring a guilt offering, by eating their sacred donations: for I am the Lord; I sanctify them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-17">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-18">Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them: When anyone of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing in Israel presents an offering, whether in payment of a vow or as a freewill offering that is offered to the Lord as a burnt offering,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-19">to be acceptable in your behalf it shall be a male without blemish, of the cattle or the sheep or the goats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-20">You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable in your behalf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-21">When anyone offers a sacrifice of well-being to the Lord, in fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, to be acceptable it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-22">Anything blind, or injured, or maimed, or having a discharge or an itch or scabs—these you shall not offer to the Lord or put any of them on the altar as offerings by fire to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-23">An ox or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short you may present for a freewill offering; but it will not be accepted for a vow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-24">Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the Lord; such you shall not do within your land,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-25">nor shall you accept any such animals from a foreigner to offer as food to your God; since they are mutilated, with a blemish in them, they shall not be accepted in your behalf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-26">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-27">When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as the Lord’s offering by fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-28">But you shall not slaughter, from the herd or the flock, an animal with its young on the same day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-29">When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it so that it may be acceptable in your behalf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-30">It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall not leave any of it until morning: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-31">Thus you shall keep my commandments and observe them: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-32">You shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel: I am the Lord; I sanctify you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-22-33">I who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
