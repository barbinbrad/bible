He will dwell with them; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-4">he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-5">And the one who was seated on the throne said, “See, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-6">Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-7">Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be my children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-8">But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, the murderers, the fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-10">And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-11">It has the glory of God and a radiance like a very rare jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-12">It has a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-13">on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-14">And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-15">The angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-16">The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width; and he measured the city with his rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-17">He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits by human measurement, which the angel was using.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-18">The wall is built of jasper, while the city is pure gold, clear as glass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-19">The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-20">the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-21">And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each of the gates is a single pearl, and the street of the city is pure gold, transparent as glass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-22">I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-23">And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-24">The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-25">Its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-26">People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rev-21-27">But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Revelation+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Revelation+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
