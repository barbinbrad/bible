for they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-12">These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-13">wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-14">And to these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-15">to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-16">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling ), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-17">But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-18">that they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-19">These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-20">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-21">keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-22">And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-23">and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-24">Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jude-1-25">to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord,  glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore.
