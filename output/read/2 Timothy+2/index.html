But the word of God is not chained.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-10">Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-11">The saying is sure: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-12">if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-13">if we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-14">Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-15">Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-16">Avoid profane chatter, for it will lead people into more and more impiety,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-17">and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-18">who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place. They are upsetting the faith of some.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-19">But God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who calls on the name of the Lord turn away from wickedness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-20">In a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for special use, some for ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-21">All who cleanse themselves of the things I have mentioned will become special utensils, dedicated and useful to the owner of the house, ready for every good work.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-22">Shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-23">Have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-24">And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone, an apt teacher, patient,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-25">correcting opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Tim-2-26">and that they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Timothy+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Timothy+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
