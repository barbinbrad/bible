And they said, Seven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-6">And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-7">And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-8">And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-9">And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-10">And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-13">And he left them, and again entering into  departed to the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-14">And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-15">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-16">And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-17">And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-18">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-19">When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-20">And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-21">And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-22">And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-23">And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-24">And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold  as trees, walking.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-25">Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-26">And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-27">And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-28">And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-29">And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-30">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-32">And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-33">But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-34">And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-35">For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospelâ€™s shall save it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-36">For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-37">For what should a man give in exchange for his life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-8-38">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
