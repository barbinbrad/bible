our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and overcome by its heat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-5">For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow, and there is no return from our death, because it is sealed up and no one turns back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-6">“Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use of the creation to the full as in youth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-7">Let us take our fill of costly wine and perfumes, and let no flower of spring pass us by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-8">Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-9">Let none of us fail to share in our revelry; everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment, because this is our portion, and this our lot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-10">Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow or regard the gray hairs of the aged.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-11">But let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to be useless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-12">“Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-13">He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-14">He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-15">the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his manner of life is unlike that of others, and his ways are strange.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-16">We are considered by him as something base, and he avoids our ways as unclean; he calls the last end of the righteous happy, and boasts that God is his father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-17">Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-18">for if the righteous man is God’s child, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-19">Let us test him with insult and torture, so that we may find out how gentle he is, and make trial of his forbearance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-20">Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-21">Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray, for their wickedness blinded them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-22">and they did not know the secret purposes of God, nor hoped for the wages of holiness, nor discerned the prize for blameless souls;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-23">for God created us for incorruption, and made us in the image of his own eternity,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-2-24">but through the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his company experience it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Wisdom+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
