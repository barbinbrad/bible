How can the clay pot associate with the iron kettle? The pot will strike against it and be smashed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-3">A rich person does wrong, and even adds insults; a poor person suffers wrong, and must add apologies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-4">A rich person will exploit you if you can be of use to him, but if you are in need he will abandon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-5">If you own something, he will live with you; he will drain your resources without a qualm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-6">When he needs you he will deceive you, and will smile at you and encourage you; he will speak to you kindly and say, “What do you need?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-7">He will embarrass you with his delicacies, until he has drained you two or three times, and finally he will laugh at you. Should he see you afterwards, he will pass you by and shake his head at you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-8">Take care not to be led astray and humiliated when you are enjoying yourself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-9">When an influential person invites you, be reserved, and he will invite you more insistently.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-10">Do not be forward, or you may be rebuffed; do not stand aloof, or you will be forgotten.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-11">Do not try to treat him as an equal, or trust his lengthy conversations; for he will test you by prolonged talk, and while he smiles he will be examining you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-12">Cruel are those who do not keep your secrets; they will not spare you harm or imprisonment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-13">Be on your guard and very careful, for you are walking about with your own downfall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-14">Every creature loves its like, and every person the neighbor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-15">All living beings associate with their own kind, and people stick close to those like themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-16">What does a wolf have in common with a lamb? No more has a sinner with the devout.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-17">What peace is there between a hyena and a dog? And what peace between the rich and the poor?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-18">Wild asses in the wilderness are the prey of lions; likewise the poor are feeding grounds for the rich.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-19">Humility is an abomination to the proud; likewise the poor are an abomination to the rich.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-20">When the rich person totters, he is supported by friends, but when the humble falls, he is pushed away even by friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-21">If the rich person slips, many come to the rescue; he speaks unseemly words, but they justify him. If the humble person slips, they even criticize him; he talks sense, but is not given a hearing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-22">The rich person speaks and all are silent; they extol to the clouds what he says. The poor person speaks and they say, “Who is this fellow?” And should he stumble, they even push him down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-23">Riches are good if they are free from sin; poverty is evil only in the opinion of the ungodly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-24">The heart changes the countenance, either for good or for evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-13-25">The sign of a happy heart is a cheerful face, but to devise proverbs requires painful thinking.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
