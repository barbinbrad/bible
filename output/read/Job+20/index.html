My thoughts urge me to answer, because of the agitation within me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-3">I hear censure that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-4">Do you not know this from of old, ever since mortals were placed on earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-5">that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless is but for a moment?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-6">Even though they mount up high as the heavens, and their head reaches to the clouds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-7">they will perish forever like their own dung; those who have seen them will say, ‘Where are they?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-8">They will fly away like a dream, and not be found; they will be chased away like a vision of the night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-9">The eye that saw them will see them no more, nor will their place behold them any longer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-10">Their children will seek the favor of the poor, and their hands will give back their wealth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-11">Their bodies, once full of youth, will lie down in the dust with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-12">“Though wickedness is sweet in their mouth, though they hide it under their tongues,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-13">though they are loath to let it go, and hold it in their mouths,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-14">yet their food is turned in their stomachs; it is the venom of asps within them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-15">They swallow down riches and vomit them up again; God casts them out of their bellies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-16">They will suck the poison of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-17">They will not look on the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-18">They will give back the fruit of their toil, and will not swallow it down; from the profit of their trading they will get no enjoyment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-19">For they have crushed and abandoned the poor, they have seized a house that they did not build.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-20">“They knew no quiet in their bellies; in their greed they let nothing escape.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-21">There was nothing left after they had eaten; therefore their prosperity will not endure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-22">In full sufficiency they will be in distress; all the force of misery will come upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-23">To fill their belly to the full God will send his fierce anger into them, and rain it upon them as their food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-24">They will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike them through.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-25">It is drawn forth and comes out of their body, and the glittering point comes out of their gall; terrors come upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-26">Utter darkness is laid up for their treasures; a fire fanned by no one will devour them; what is left in their tent will be consumed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-27">The heavens will reveal their iniquity, and the earth will rise up against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-28">The possessions of their house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God’s wrath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-20-29">This is the portion of the wicked from God, the heritage decreed for them by God.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
