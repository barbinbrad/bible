they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged  backward.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-5">Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-6">From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it;  wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-7">Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-8">And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-9">Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-10">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-11">What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-12">When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-13">Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,—I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-14">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-15">And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-16">Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-17">learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-18">Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-19">If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-20">but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-21">How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-22">Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-23">Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-24">Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-25">and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-26">and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-27">Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-28">But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-30">For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-1-31">And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Song of Solomon+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
