And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-16">and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-17">And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-18">Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-19">And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-20">And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-21">neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-22">And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-23">And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after :&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-24">for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-25">But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-26">And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-27">They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-28">Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-29">but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-30">after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-31">In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-32">Remember Lotâ€™s wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-33">Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose  shall preserve it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-34">I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-35">There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-17-36">And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body , thither will the eagles also be gathered together.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
