And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse  wrongfully; and be content with your wages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-15">And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-16">John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and  fire:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-17">whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-18">With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-19">but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brotherâ€™s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-20">added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-21">Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-22">and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-23">And Jesus himself, when he began , was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the  of Heli,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-24">the  of Matthat, the  of Levi, the  of Melchi, the  of Jannai, the  of Joseph,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-25">the  of Mattathias, the  of Amos, the  of Nahum, the  of Esli, the  of Naggai,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-26">the  of Maath, the  of Mattathias, the  of Semein, the  of Josech, the  of Joda,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-27">the  of Joanan, the  of Rhesa, the  of Zerubbabel, the  of Shealtiel, the  of Neri,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-28">the  of Melchi, the  of Addi, the  of Cosam, the  of Elmadam, the  of Er,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-29">the  of Jesus, the  of Eliezer, the  of Jorim, the  of Matthat, the  of Levi,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-30">the  of Symeon, the  of Judas, the  of Joseph, the  of Jonam, the  of Eliakim,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-31">the  of Melea, the  of Menna, the  of Mattatha, the  of Nathan, the  of David,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-32">the  of Jesse, the  of Obed, the  of Boaz, the  of Salmon, the  of Nahshon,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-33">the  of Amminadab, the  of Arni, the  of Hezron, the  of Perez, the  of Judah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-34">the  of Jacob, the  of Isaac, the  of Abraham, the  of Terah, the  of Nahor,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-35">the  of Serug, the  of Reu, the  of Peleg, the  of Eber, the  of Shelah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-36">the  of Cainan, the  of Arphaxad, the  of Shem, the  of Noah, the  of Lamech,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-37">the  of Methuselah, the  of Enoch, the  of Jared, the  of Mahalaleel, the  of Cainan,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-38">the  of Enos, the  of Seth, the  of Adam, the  of God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
