Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-8">Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-9">Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-10">And the crowds asked him, “What then should we do?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-11">In reply he said to them, “Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-12">Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-13">He said to them, “Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-14">Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what should we do?” He said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-15">As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-16">John answered all of them by saying, “I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-17">His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-18">So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-19">But Herod the ruler, who had been rebuked by him because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil things that Herod had done,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-20">added to them all by shutting up John in prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-21">Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-22">and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-3-23">Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work.
