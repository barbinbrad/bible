And the Israelites said, “Tell us, how did this criminal act come about?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-4">The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-5">The lords of Gibeah rose up against me, and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine until she died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-6">Then I took my concubine and cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the whole extent of Israel’s territory; for they have committed a vile outrage in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-7">So now, you Israelites, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-8">All the people got up as one, saying, “We will not any of us go to our tents, nor will any of us return to our houses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-9">But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-10">We will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the troops, who are going to repay Gibeah of Benjamin for all the disgrace that they have done in Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-11">So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-12">The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What crime is this that has been committed among you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-13">Now then, hand over those scoundrels in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death, and purge the evil from Israel.” But the Benjaminites would not listen to their kinsfolk, the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-14">The Benjaminites came together out of the towns to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-15">On that day the Benjaminites mustered twenty-six thousand armed men from their towns, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-16">Of all this force, there were seven hundred picked men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair, and not miss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-17">And the Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand armed men, all of them warriors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-18">The Israelites proceeded to go up to Bethel, where they inquired of God, “Which of us shall go up first to battle against the Benjaminites?” And the Lord answered, “Judah shall go up first.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-19">Then the Israelites got up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-20">The Israelites went out to battle against Benjamin; and the Israelites drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-21">The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah, and struck down on that day twenty-two thousand of the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-22">The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until the evening; and they inquired of the Lord, “Shall we again draw near to battle against our kinsfolk the Benjaminites?” And the Lord said, “Go up against them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-23">The Israelites took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-24">So the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites the second day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-25">Benjamin moved out against them from Gibeah the second day, and struck down eighteen thousand of the Israelites, all of them armed men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-26">Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went back to Bethel and wept, sitting there before the Lord; they fasted that day until evening. Then they offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being before the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-27">And the Israelites inquired of the Lord (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-28">and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, “Shall we go out once more to battle against our kinsfolk the Benjaminites, or shall we desist?” The Lord answered, “Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-29">So Israel stationed men in ambush around Gibeah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-30">Then the Israelites went up against the Benjaminites on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as before.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-31">When the Benjaminites went out against the army, they were drawn away from the city. As before they began to inflict casualties on the troops, along the main roads, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, as well as in the open country, killing about thirty men of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-32">The Benjaminites thought, “They are being routed before us, as previously.” But the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city toward the roads.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-33">The main body of the Israelites drew back its battle line to Baal-tamar, while those Israelites who were in ambush rushed out of their place west of Geba.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-34">There came against Gibeah ten thousand picked men out of all Israel, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was close upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-35">The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel; and the Israelites destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin that day, all of them armed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-36">Then the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated. The Israelites gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted to the troops in ambush that they had stationed against Gibeah. &nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-37">The troops in ambush rushed quickly upon Gibeah. Then they put the whole city to the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-38">Now the agreement between the main body of Israel and the men in ambush was that when they sent up a cloud of smoke out of the city&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-39">the main body of Israel should turn in battle. But Benjamin had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites, killing about thirty of them; so they thought, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-40">But when the cloud, a column of smoke, began to rise out of the city, the Benjaminites looked behind them—and there was the whole city going up in smoke toward the sky!&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-41">Then the main body of Israel turned, and the Benjaminites were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-42">Therefore they turned away from the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the city were slaughtering them in between.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-43">Cutting down the Benjaminites, they pursued them from Nohah and trod them down as far as a place east of Gibeah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-44">Eighteen thousand Benjaminites fell, all of them courageous fighters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-45">When they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, five thousand of them were cut down on the main roads, and they were pursued as far as Gidom, and two thousand of them were slain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-46">So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand arms-bearing men, all of them courageous fighters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-47">But six hundred turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-20-48">Meanwhile, the Israelites turned back against the Benjaminites, and put them to the sword—the city, the people, the animals, and all that remained. Also the remaining towns they set on fire.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Judges+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judges+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
