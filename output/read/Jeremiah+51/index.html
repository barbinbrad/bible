and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-3">Against  bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against  lifteth himself up in his coat of mail: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-4">And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-5">For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-6">Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Jehovah’s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-7">Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-8">Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-9">We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-10">Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-11">Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-12">Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both purposed and done that which he spake concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-13">O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-14">Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, , Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the canker-worm; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-15">He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-16">When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-17">Every man is become brutish  without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-18">They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-19">The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and  is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-20">Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war: and with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-21">and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-22">and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein; and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-23">and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke ; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and deputies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-24">And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-25">Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-26">And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-27">Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker-worm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-28">Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors thereof, and all the deputies thereof, and all the land of their dominion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-29">And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-30">The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-31">One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-32">and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-33">For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-34">Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-35">The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-36">Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-37">And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-38">They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions’ whelps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-39">When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-40">I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-41">How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-42">The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-43">Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-44">And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-45">My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-46">And let not your heart faint, neither fear ye for the tidings that shall be heard in the land; for tidings shall come one year, and after that in another year  tidings, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-47">Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-48">Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-49">As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-50">Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-51">We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-52">Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-53">Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-54">The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-55">For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-56">for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-57">And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-58">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-59">The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-60">And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-61">And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-62">and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-63">And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-51-64">and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+50/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+52/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
