Who then will offer willingly, consecrating themselves today to the Lord?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-6">Then the leaders of ancestral houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-7">They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-8">Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, into the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-9">Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with single mind they had offered freely to the Lord; King David also rejoiced greatly.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-10">Then David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly; David said: “Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our ancestor Israel, forever and ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-11">Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-12">Riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might; and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-13">And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your glorious name.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-14">“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to make this freewill offering? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-15">For we are aliens and transients before you, as were all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-16">O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-17">I know, my God, that you search the heart, and take pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-18">O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-19">Grant to my son Solomon that with single mind he may keep your commandments, your decrees, and your statutes, performing all of them, and that he may build the temple for which I have made provision.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-20">Then David said to the whole assembly, “Bless the Lord your God.” And all the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the Lord and the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-21">On the next day they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their libations, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-22">and they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy. They made David’s son Solomon king a second time; they anointed him as the Lord’s prince, and Zadok as priest. &nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-23">Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord, succeeding his father David as king; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-24">All the leaders and the mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-25">The Lord highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-26">Thus David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-27">The period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-28">He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and his son Solomon succeeded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-29">Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the records of the seer Samuel, and in the records of the prophet Nathan, and in the records of the seer Gad,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-29-30">with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the events that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the earth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Chronicles+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Chronicles+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
