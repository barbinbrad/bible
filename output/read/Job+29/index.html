And when the eye saw , it gave witness unto me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-15">I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-16">I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-17">And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-19">My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-20">My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-21">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-22">After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-23">And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide  for the latter rain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-24">I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-29-25">I chose out their way, and sat  chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+30/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
