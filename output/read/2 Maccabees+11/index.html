He intended to make the city a home for Greeks,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-3">and to levy tribute on the temple as he did on the sacred places of the other nations, and to put up the high priesthood for sale every year.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-4">He took no account whatever of the power of God, but was elated with his ten thousands of infantry, and his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-5">Invading Judea, he approached Beth-zur, which was a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, and pressed it hard.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-6">When Maccabeus and his men got word that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people, with lamentations and tears, prayed the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-7">Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he urged the others to risk their lives with him to aid their kindred. Then they eagerly rushed off together.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-8">And there, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white and brandishing weapons of gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-9">And together they all praised the merciful God, and were strengthened in heart, ready to assail not only humans but the wildest animals or walls of iron.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-10">They advanced in battle order, having their heavenly ally, for the Lord had mercy on them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-11">They hurled themselves like lions against the enemy, and laid low eleven thousand of them and sixteen hundred cavalry, and forced all the rest to flee.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-12">Most of them got away stripped and wounded, and Lysias himself escaped by disgraceful flight.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-13">As he was not without intelligence, he pondered over the defeat that had befallen him, and realized that the Hebrews were invincible because the mighty God fought on their side. So he sent to them&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-14">and persuaded them to settle everything on just terms, promising that he would persuade the king, constraining him to be their friend.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-15">Maccabeus, having regard for the common good, agreed to all that Lysias urged. For the king granted every request in behalf of the Jews which Maccabeus delivered to Lysias in writing.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-16">The letter written to the Jews by Lysias was to this effect: “Lysias to the people of the Jews, greetings. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-17">John and Absalom, who were sent by you, have delivered your signed communication and have asked about the matters indicated in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-18">I have informed the king of everything that needed to be brought before him, and he has agreed to what was possible.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-19">If you will maintain your goodwill toward the government, I will endeavor in the future to help promote your welfare.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-20">And concerning such matters and their details, I have ordered these men and my representatives to confer with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-21">Farewell. The one hundred forty-eighth year, Dioscorinthius twenty-fourth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-22">The king’s letter ran thus: “King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-23">Now that our father has gone on to the gods, we desire that the subjects of the kingdom be undisturbed in caring for their own affairs.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-24">We have heard that the Jews do not consent to our father’s change to Greek customs, but prefer their own way of living and ask that their own customs be allowed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-25">Accordingly, since we choose that this nation also should be free from disturbance, our decision is that their temple be restored to them and that they shall live according to the customs of their ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-26">You will do well, therefore, to send word to them and give them pledges of friendship, so that they may know our policy and be of good cheer and go on happily in the conduct of their own affairs.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-27">To the nation the king’s letter was as follows: “King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greetings. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-28">If you are well, it is as we desire. We also are in good health.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-29">Menelaus has informed us that you wish to return home and look after your own affairs.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-30">Therefore those who go home by the thirtieth of Xanthicus will have our pledge of friendship and full permission&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-31">for the Jews to enjoy their own food and laws, just as formerly, and none of them shall be molested in any way for what may have been done in ignorance.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-32">And I have also sent Menelaus to encourage you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-33">Farewell. The one hundred forty-eighth year, Xanthicus fifteenth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-34">The Romans also sent them a letter, which read thus: “Quintus Memmius and Titus Manius, envoys of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-35">With regard to what Lysias the kinsman of the king has granted you, we also give consent.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-36">But as to the matters that he decided are to be referred to the king, as soon as you have considered them, send some one promptly so that we may make proposals appropriate for you. For we are on our way to Antioch.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-37">Therefore make haste and send messengers so that we may have your judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Macc-11-38">Farewell. The one hundred forty-eighth year, Xanthicus fifteenth.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Maccabees+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Maccabees+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
