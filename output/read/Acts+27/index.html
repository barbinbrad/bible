It was a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-13">When a moderate south wind began to blow, they thought they could achieve their purpose; so they weighed anchor and began to sail past Crete, close to the shore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-14">But soon a violent wind, called the northeaster, rushed down from Crete.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-15">Since the ship was caught and could not be turned head-on into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-16">By running under the lee of a small island called Cauda we were scarcely able to get the ship’s boat under control.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-17">After hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they would run on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-18">We were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-19">and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ship’s tackle overboard.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-20">When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest raged, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-21">Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul then stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-22">I urge you now to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-23">For last night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-24">and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before the emperor; and indeed, God has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-25">So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-26">But we will have to run aground on some island.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-27">When the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-28">So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-29">Fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-30">But when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea, on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-33">Just before daybreak, Paul urged all of them to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food, having eaten nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-34">Therefore I urge you to take some food, for it will help you survive; for none of you will lose a hair from your heads.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-35">After he had said this, he took bread; and giving thanks to God in the presence of all, he broke it and began to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-36">Then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-37">(We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons in the ship.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-38">After they had satisfied their hunger, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-39">In the morning they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned to run the ship ashore, if they could.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-40">So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea. At the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steering-oars; then hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-41">But striking a reef, they ran the ship aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-42">The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none might swim away and escape;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-43">but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-27-44">and the rest to follow, some on planks and others on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
