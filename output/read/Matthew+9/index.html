And he arose, and followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-10">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-11">And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-12">But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-13">But go ye and learn what  meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-14">Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-15">And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-16">And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-17">Neither do  put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-18">While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-19">And Jesus arose, and followed him, and  his disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-20">And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-21">for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-22">But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-23">And when Jesus came into the rulerâ€™s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-24">he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-25">But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-26">And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-27">And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-28">And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-29">Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-30">And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-31">But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-32">And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-33">And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-34">But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-35">And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-36">But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-37">Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-38">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
