When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-3">Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-4">But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-5">For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-6">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—“Stand up, take your bed and go to your home.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-7">And he stood up and went to his home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-8">When the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-9">As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-10">And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-11">When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-12">But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-13">Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-14">Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-15">And Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-16">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the patch pulls away from the cloak, and a worse tear is made.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-17">Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-18">While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-19">And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-20">Then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-21">for she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-22">Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-23">When Jesus came to the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-24">he said, “Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-25">But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-26">And the report of this spread throughout that district.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-27">As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, crying loudly, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-28">When he entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-29">Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-30">And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly ordered them, “See that no one knows of this.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-31">But they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-32">After they had gone away, a demoniac who was mute was brought to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-33">And when the demon had been cast out, the one who had been mute spoke; and the crowds were amazed and said, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-34">But the Pharisees said, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-35">Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-36">When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-37">Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-9-38">therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
