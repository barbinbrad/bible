You must not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-15">If a man has two wives, one of them loved and the other disliked, and if both the loved and the disliked have borne him sons, the firstborn being the son of the one who is disliked,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-16">then on the day when he wills his possessions to his sons, he is not permitted to treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the disliked, who is the firstborn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-17">He must acknowledge as firstborn the son of the one who is disliked, giving him a double portion of all that he has; since he is the first issue of his virility, the right of the firstborn is his.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-18">If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-19">then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-21-20">They shall say to the elders of his town, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious.
