And let an adversary stand at his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-7">When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-8">Let his days be few;  let another take his office.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-9">Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-10">Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek out of their desolate places.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-11">Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-12">Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-13">Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-14">Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-15">Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-16">Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay .&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-17">Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-18">He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-19">Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-20">This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-21">But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-22">For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-23">I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-24">My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-25">I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-26">Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-27">That they may know that this is thy hand;  thou, Jehovah, hast done it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-28">Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-29">Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-30">I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-109-31">For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+108/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+110/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
