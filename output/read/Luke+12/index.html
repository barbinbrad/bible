Yes, I tell you, fear him!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-6">Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God’s sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-7">But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-8">“And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-9">but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-10">And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-11">When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-12">for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-13">Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-14">But he said to him, “Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-15">And he said to them, “Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-16">Then he told them a parable: “The land of a rich man produced abundantly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-17">And he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-18">Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-19">And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-20">But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-21">So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-22">He said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-23">For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-24">Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-25">And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-26">If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that, why do you worry about the rest?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-27">Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-28">But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-29">And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not keep worrying.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-30">For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-31">Instead, strive for his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-32">“Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-33">Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-34">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-35">“Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-36">be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-37">Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-38">If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-39">“But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-40">You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-41">Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for everyone?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-42">And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves, to give them their allowance of food at the proper time?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-43">Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-44">Truly I tell you, he will put that one in charge of all his possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-45">But if that slave says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and if he begins to beat the other slaves, men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-46">the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and put him with the unfaithful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-47">That slave who knew what his master wanted, but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted, will receive a severe beating.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-48">But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-49">“I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-50">I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and what stress I am under until it is completed!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-51">Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-52">From now on five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-53">they will be divided: father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-54">He also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, ‘It is going to rain’; and so it happens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-55">And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat’; and it happens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-56">You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-57">“And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-58">Thus, when you go with your accuser before a magistrate, on the way make an effort to settle the case, or you may be dragged before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you in prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-12-59">I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
