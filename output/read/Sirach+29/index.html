If he cannot pay, the borrower has robbed the other of his money, and he has needlessly made him an enemy; he will repay him with curses and reproaches, and instead of glory will repay him with dishonor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-7">Many refuse to lend, not because of meanness, but from fear of being defrauded needlessly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-8">Nevertheless, be patient with someone in humble circumstances, and do not keep him waiting for your alms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-9">Help the poor for the commandment’s sake, and in their need do not send them away empty-handed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-10">Lose your silver for the sake of a brother or a friend, and do not let it rust under a stone and be lost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-11">Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High, and it will profit you more than gold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-12">Store up almsgiving in your treasury, and it will rescue you from every disaster;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-13">better than a stout shield and a sturdy spear, it will fight for you against the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-14">A good person will be surety for his neighbor, but the one who has lost all sense of shame will fail him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-15">Do not forget the kindness of your guarantor, for he has given his life for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-16">A sinner wastes the property of his guarantor,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-17">and the ungrateful person abandons his rescuer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-18">Being surety has ruined many who were prosperous, and has tossed them about like waves of the sea; it has driven the influential into exile, and they have wandered among foreign nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-19">The sinner comes to grief through surety; his pursuit of gain involves him in lawsuits.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-20">Assist your neighbor to the best of your ability, but be careful not to fall yourself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-21">The necessities of life are water, bread, and clothing, and also a house to assure privacy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-22">Better is the life of the poor under their own crude roof than sumptuous food in the house of others.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-23">Be content with little or much, and you will hear no reproach for being a guest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-24">It is a miserable life to go from house to house; as a guest you should not open your mouth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-25">you will play the host and provide drink without being thanked, and besides this you will hear rude words like these:&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-29-26">“Come here, stranger, prepare the table;
