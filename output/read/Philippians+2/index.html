that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-17">Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-18">and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-20">For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-21">For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child  a father,  he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-23">Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-24">but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-25">But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-26">since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-27">for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-28">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-2-30">because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Philippians+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Philippians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
