on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-9">receiving the end of your faith,  the salvation of  souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-10">Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that  unto you:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-11">searching what  or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-12">To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-13">Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-14">as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in  your ignorance:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-15">but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-16">because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-17">And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each manâ€™s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-18">knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-19">but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,  of Christ:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-20">who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-21">who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-22">Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-23">having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-24">For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-25">But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../James+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Peter+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
