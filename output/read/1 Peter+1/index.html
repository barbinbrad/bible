By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-4">and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-5">who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-6">In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-7">so that the genuineness of your faith—being more precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-8">Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-9">for you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-10">Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-11">inquiring about the person or time that the Spirit of Christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for Christ and the subsequent glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-12">It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-13">Therefore prepare your minds for action; discipline yourselves; set all your hope on the grace that Jesus Christ will bring you when he is revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-14">Like obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-15">Instead, as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-16">for it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-17">If you invoke as Father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during the time of your exile.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-18">You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-19">but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-20">He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-21">Through him you have come to trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are set on God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-22">Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-23">You have been born anew, not of perishable but of imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-1-24">For “All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass.
