And why should I not be impatient?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-5">Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-6">Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-7">Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-8">Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-9">Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-12">They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-13">They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-14">And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-21-15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
