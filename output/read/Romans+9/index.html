Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-6">But  not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-7">neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-8">That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-9">For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-10">And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one,  by our father Isaac—&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-11">for  being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-12">it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-13">Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-14">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-15">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-16">So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-17">For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-18">So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-19">Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-20">Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-21">Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-22">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-23">and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-24">us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-25">As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-26">And it shall be,  in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-27">And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-28">for the Lord will execute  word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-29">And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-31">but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at  law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-32">Wherefore? Because  not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-33">even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
