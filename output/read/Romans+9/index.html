Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-6">It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-7">and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants; but “It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-8">This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-9">For this is what the promise said, “About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-10">Nor is that all; something similar happened to Rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband, our ancestor Isaac.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-11">Even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose of election might continue,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-12">not by works but by his call) she was told, “The elder shall serve the younger.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-13">As it is written, “I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-14">What then are we to say? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-15">For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-16">So it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “I have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-18">So then he has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-19">You will say to me then, “Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-20">But who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God? Will what is molded say to the one who molds it, “Why have you made me like this?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-21">Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-22">What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-23">and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory—&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-24">including us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-25">As indeed he says in Hosea, “Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-26">“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they shall be called children of the living God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-27">And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the children of Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-28">for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-29">And as Isaiah predicted, “If the Lord of hosts had not left survivors to us, we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-30">What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-31">but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-32">Why not? Because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-9-33">as it is written, “See, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
