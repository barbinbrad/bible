From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the Lord had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-5">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-6">Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-7">Thus you shall do to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification on them, have them shave their whole body with a razor and wash their clothes, and so cleanse themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-8">Then let them take a young bull and its grain offering of choice flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull for a sin offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-9">You shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and assemble the whole congregation of the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-10">When you bring the Levites before the Lord, the Israelites shall lay their hands on the Levites,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-11">and Aaron shall present the Levites before the Lord as an elevation offering from the Israelites, that they may do the service of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-12">The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and he shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-13">Then you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and you shall present them as an elevation offering to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-14">Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the other Israelites, and the Levites shall be mine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-15">Thereafter the Levites may go in to do service at the tent of meeting, once you have cleansed them and presented them as an elevation offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-16">For they are unreservedly given to me from among the Israelites; I have taken them for myself, in place of all that open the womb, the firstborn of all the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-17">For all the firstborn among the Israelites are mine, both human and animal. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-18">but I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-19">Moreover, I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to do the service for the Israelites at the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the Israelites, in order that there may be no plague among the Israelites for coming too close to the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-20">Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation of the Israelites did with the Levites accordingly; the Israelites did with the Levites just as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-21">The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them as an elevation offering before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-22">Thereafter the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting in attendance on Aaron and his sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-23">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-24">This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall begin to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-25">and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from the duty of the service and serve no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-26">They may assist their brothers in the tent of meeting in carrying out their duties, but they shall perform no service. Thus you shall do with the Levites in assigning their duties.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
