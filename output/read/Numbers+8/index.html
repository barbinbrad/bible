And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-11">and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-12">And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-13">And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-14">Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-15">And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-16">For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-17">For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-18">And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-19">And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-20">Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-21">And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-22">And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-23">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-24">This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-25">and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-8-26">but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
