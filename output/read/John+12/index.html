Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-28">Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, , I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-29">The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-30">Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-33">But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-34">The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-35">Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-36">While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-37">But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-38">that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-39">For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-40">He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-41">These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-42">Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess , lest they should be put out of the synagogue:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-43">for they loved the glory  of men more than the glory  of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-44">And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-45">And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-47">And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-49">For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-50">And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
