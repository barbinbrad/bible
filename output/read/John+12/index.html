Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-3">Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus’ feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-5">“Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-6">(He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-7">Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-8">You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-9">When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-10">So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-11">since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-12">The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-13">So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord— the King of Israel!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-14">Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-15">“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-16">His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-17">So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-18">It was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-19">The Pharisees then said to one another, “You see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-20">Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-21">They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-22">Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-23">Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-24">Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-25">Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-26">Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-27">“Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-28">Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-29">The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-30">Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-31">Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-32">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-33">He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-34">The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-35">Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-36">While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-37">Although he had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-38">This was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-39">And so they could not believe, because Isaiah also said,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-40">“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they might not look with their eyes, and understand with their heart and turn— and I would heal them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-41">Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-42">Nevertheless many, even of the authorities, believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-43">for they loved human glory more than the glory that comes from God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-44">Then Jesus cried aloud: “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-45">And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-46">I have come as light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-47">I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them, for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-48">The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-49">for I have not spoken on my own, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-12-50">And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak, therefore, I speak just as the Father has told me.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
