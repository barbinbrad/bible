It is the same way with the rich; in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-11">Blessed is anyone who endures temptation. Such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-12">No one, when tempted, should say, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-13">But one is tempted by one’s own desire, being lured and enticed by it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-14">then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and that sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-15">Do not be deceived, my beloved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-16">Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-17">In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-18">You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-19">for your anger does not produce God’s righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-20">Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-21">But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-22">For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-23">for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-24">But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-25">If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-1-26">Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hebrews+13/"><svg
