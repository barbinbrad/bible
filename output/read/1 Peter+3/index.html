that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-2">beholding your chaste behavior  with fear.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-3">Whose  let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-4">but  the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-5">For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-6">as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-7">Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with  according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-8">Finally,  ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-9">not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-10">For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-11">And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-13">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-14">But even if ye should suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, blessed : and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-15">but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord:  ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-16">having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-17">For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-18">Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-19">in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-20">that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-21">which also after a true likeness doth now save you,  baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Pet-3-22">who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Peter+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Peter+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
