A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-2">I , Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-3">Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-4">For the king’s word  power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-5">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-6">for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-7">for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-8">There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-9">All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun:  a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-10">So I saw the wicked buried, and they came ; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-11">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-12">Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-13">but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong  days,  as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-14">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-15">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that shall abide with him in his labor  the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-16">When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),&nbsp;</span><span id="Eccl-8-17">then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ecclesiastes+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ecclesiastes+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
