They appealed to him&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-3">and requested, as a favor to them against Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem. They were, in fact, planning an ambush to kill him along the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-4">Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-5">“So,” he said, “let those of you who have the authority come down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-6">After he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-7">When he arrived, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem surrounded him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-8">Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way committed an offense against the law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against the emperor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-9">But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-10">Paul said, “I am appealing to the emperor’s tribunal; this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-11">Now if I am in the wrong and have committed something for which I deserve to die, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to the emperor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-12">Then Festus, after he had conferred with his council, replied, “You have appealed to the emperor; to the emperor you will go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-13">After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-14">Since they were staying there several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-15">When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-16">I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-17">So when they met here, I lost no time, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-18">When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the crimes that I was expecting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-19">Instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-20">Since I was at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-21">But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his Imperial Majesty, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to the emperor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-22">Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-23">So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then Festus gave the order and Paul was brought in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-24">And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish community petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-25">But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and when he appealed to his Imperial Majesty, I decided to send him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-26">But I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write—&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-25-27">for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
