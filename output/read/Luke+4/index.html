And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-3">And the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-4">And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-5">And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-6">And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-7">If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-8">And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-9">And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-10">for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-11">and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-12">And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-13">And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-14">And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-15">And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-16">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-17">And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-18">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-19">To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-20">And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-21">And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-22">And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-23">And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-24">And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-25">But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-26">and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-27">And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-28">And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-29">and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-30">But he passing through the midst of them went his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-31">And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-32">and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-33">And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-34">Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-35">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-36">And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-37">And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-38">And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-39">And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-40">And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-41">And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-42">And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-43">But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-4-44">And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
