Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-9">If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-10">And the Philistine said, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-11">When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-12">Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-13">The three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle; the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-14">David was the youngest; the three eldest followed Saul,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-15">but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-16">For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-17">Jesse said to his son David, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-18">also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare, and bring some token from them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-19">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-20">David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-21">Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-22">David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-23">As he talked with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-24">All the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled from him and were very much afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-25">The Israelites said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. The king will greatly enrich the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter and make his family free in Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-26">David said to the men who stood by him, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-27">The people answered him in the same way, “So shall it be done for the man who kills him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-28">His eldest brother Eliab heard him talking to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David. He said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart; for you have come down just to see the battle.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-29">David said, “What have I done now? It was only a question.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-30">He turned away from him toward another and spoke in the same way; and the people answered him again as before.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-31">When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul; and he sent for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-32">David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-33">Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-34">But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb from the flock,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-35">I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-36">Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-37">David said, “The Lord, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the Lord be with you!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-38">Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-39">David strapped Saul’s sword over the armor, and he tried in vain to walk, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these; for I am not used to them.” So David removed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-40">Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-41">The Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-42">When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-43">The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-44">The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the field.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-45">But David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-46">This very day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army this very day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-47">and that all this assembly may know that the Lord does not save by sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord’s and he will give you into our hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-48">When the Philistine drew nearer to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-49">David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, striking down the Philistine and killing him; there was no sword in David’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-51">Then David ran and stood over the Philistine; he grasped his sword, drew it out of its sheath, and killed him; then he cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. &nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-52">The troops of Israel and Judah rose up with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-53">The Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-54">David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-55">When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-56">The king said, “Inquire whose son the stripling is.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-57">On David’s return from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-17-58">Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
