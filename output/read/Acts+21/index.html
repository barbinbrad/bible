Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-5">When our days there were ended, we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them, with wives and children, escorted us outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-6">and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-7">When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-8">The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-9">He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-10">While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-11">He came to us and took Paul’s belt, bound his own feet and hands with it, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-12">When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-13">Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-14">Since he would not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “The Lord’s will be done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-15">After these days we got ready and started to go up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-17">When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-18">The next day Paul went with us to visit James; and all the elders were present.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-19">After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-20">When they heard it, they praised God. Then they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-21">They have been told about you that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-22">What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-23">So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-24">Join these men, go through the rite of purification with them, and pay for the shaving of their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself observe and guard the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-25">But as for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having purified himself, he entered the temple with them, making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-27">When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who had seen him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd. They seized him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-28">shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place; more than that, he has actually brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-29">For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-30">Then all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-31">While they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-32">Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-33">Then the tribune came, arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; he inquired who he was and what he had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-35">When Paul came to the steps, the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-36">The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Away with him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-37">Just as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?” The tribune replied, “Do you know Greek?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-38">Then you are not the Egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-39">Paul replied, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-21-40">When he had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence; and when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
