Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-2">So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-3">then come, let us go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-4">So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-5">As they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities all around them, so that no one pursued them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-6">Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-7">and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-8">And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So it was called Allon-bacuth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-9">God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-10">God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall you be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” So he was called Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-11">God said to him, “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-12">The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-13">Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-14">Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-15">So Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-16">Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-17">When she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-18">As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-19">So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-20">and Jacob set up a pillar at her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s tomb, which is there to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-21">Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-22">While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. &nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-23">The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-24">The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-25">The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-26">The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-27">Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had resided as aliens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-28">Now the days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-35-29">And Isaac breathed his last; he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+34/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+36/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
