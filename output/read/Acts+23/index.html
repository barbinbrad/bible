and the assembly was divided.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-9">And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-12">And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-13">And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-14">And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-15">Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-16">But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-17">And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-19">And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-21">Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-22">So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-23">And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-24">and  provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-25">And he wrote a letter after this form:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-27">This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-28">And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-29">whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-30">And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-31">So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-32">But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-33">and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-34">And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-23-35">I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
