Indeed, an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-3">And they will do this because they have not known the Father or me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-4">But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you about them. “I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-5">But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-6">But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-7">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-8">And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-9">about sin, because they do not believe in me;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-10">about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-11">about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-12">“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-13">When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-14">He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-15">All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-16">“A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little while, and you will see me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-17">Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’; and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-18">They said, “What does he mean by this ‘a little while’? We do not know what he is talking about.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-19">Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, “Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-20">Very truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will have pain, but your pain will turn into joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-21">When a woman is in labor, she has pain, because her hour has come. But when her child is born, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-22">So you have pain now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-23">On that day you will ask nothing of me. Very truly, I tell you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-24">Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-25">“I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly of the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-26">On that day you will ask in my name. I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-27">for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-28">I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-29">His disciples said, “Yes, now you are speaking plainly, not in any figure of speech!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-30">Now we know that you know all things, and do not need to have anyone question you; by this we believe that you came from God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-31">Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-32">The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each one to his home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-16-33">I have said this to you, so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. But take courage; I have conquered the world!”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
