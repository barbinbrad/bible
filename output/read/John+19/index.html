And  saith unto them, Behold, the man!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify , crucify ! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-8">When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-9">and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-10">Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-11">Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-12">Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-14">Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-15">They therefore cried out, Away with , away with , crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-16">Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-17">They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-20">This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew,  in Latin,  in Greek.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-24">They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-25">These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the  of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own .&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-28">After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-29">There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-31">The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high ), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and  they might be taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-32">The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-34">howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-35">And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-36">For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave  leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-39">And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-19-42">There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
