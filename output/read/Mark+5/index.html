I adjure thee by God, torment me not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-8">For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-9">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-10">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-11">Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-12">And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-13">And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea,  about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-14">And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-15">And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind,  him that had the legion: and they were afraid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-16">And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-17">And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-18">And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-19">And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and  he had mercy on thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-20">And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-21">And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-22">And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-23">and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: , that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-24">And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-25">And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-26">and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-27">having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-28">For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-29">And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-30">And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power  from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-31">And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-32">And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-33">But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-34">And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-35">While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogueâ€™s , saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-36">But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-37">And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-38">And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and  weeping and wailing greatly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-39">And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-40">And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-41">And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-42">And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-5-43">And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that  should be given her to eat.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
