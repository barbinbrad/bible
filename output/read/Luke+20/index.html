Who is it who gave you this authority?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-3">He answered them, “I will also ask you a question, and you tell me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-4">Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-5">They discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-6">But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us; for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-7">So they answered that they did not know where it came from.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-8">Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-9">He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenants, and went to another country for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-10">When the season came, he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-11">Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-12">And he sent still a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-13">Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-14">But when the tenants saw him, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-16">He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “Heaven forbid!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-17">But he looked at them and said, “What then does this text mean: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-19">When the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-20">So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest, in order to trap him by what he said, so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-21">So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and you show deference to no one, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-23">But he perceived their craftiness and said to them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-24">“Show me a denarius. Whose head and whose title does it bear?” They said, “The emperor’s.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-25">He said to them, “Then give to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-26">And they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said; and being amazed by his answer, they became silent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-27">Some Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came to him&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-28">and asked him a question, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-29">Now there were seven brothers; the first married, and died childless;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-30">then the second&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-31">and the third married her, and so in the same way all seven died childless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-32">Finally the woman also died.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-33">In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had married her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-34">Jesus said to them, “Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-35">but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-36">Indeed they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-37">And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed, in the story about the bush, where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-38">Now he is God not of the dead, but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-39">Then some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-40">For they no longer dared to ask him another question.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-41">Then he said to them, “How can they say that the Messiah is David’s son?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-42">For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-43">until I make your enemies your footstool.”’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-44">David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-45">In the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-46">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-20-47">They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
