See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-4">Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-5">Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this house!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-6">And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person; but if not, it will return to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-7">Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-8">Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-9">cure the sick who are there, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-10">But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-11">‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-12">I tell you, on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-13">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-14">But at the judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-15">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-16">“Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-17">The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-18">He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-19">See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-20">Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-21">At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-22">All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-23">Then turning to the disciples, Jesus said to them privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-24">For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-25">Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he said, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-26">He said to him, “What is written in the law? What do you read there?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-27">He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-28">And he said to him, “You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-29">But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-30">Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-31">Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-32">So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-33">But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-34">He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-35">The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, ‘Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-36">Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-37">He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-38">Now as they went on their way, he entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-39">She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he was saying.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-40">But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-41">But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-10-42">there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
