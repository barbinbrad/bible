Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-2">O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-3">Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-4">In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-5">To you they cried, and were saved; in you they trusted, and were not put to shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-6">But I am a worm, and not human; scorned by others, and despised by the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-7">All who see me mock at me; they make mouths at me, they shake their heads;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-8">“Commit your cause to the Lord; let him deliver— let him rescue the one in whom he delights!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-9">Yet it was you who took me from the womb; you kept me safe on my mother’s breast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-10">On you I was cast from my birth, and since my mother bore me you have been my God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-11">Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-12">Many bulls encircle me, strong bulls of Bashan surround me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-13">they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-14">I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-15">my mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-16">For dogs are all around me; a company of evildoers encircles me. My hands and feet have shriveled;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-17">I can count all my bones. They stare and gloat over me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-18">they divide my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-19">But you, O Lord, do not be far away! O my help, come quickly to my aid!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-20">Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-21">Save me from the mouth of the lion! From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-22">I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-23">You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him; stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-24">For he did not despise or abhor the affliction of the afflicted; he did not hide his face from me, but heard when I cried to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-25">From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-26">The poor shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the Lord. May your hearts live forever!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-27">All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-28">For dominion belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-29">To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, and I shall live for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-30">Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-22-31">and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, saying that he has done it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
