You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-6">that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-7">This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-8">and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-9">For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-10">so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-11">May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-12">giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-13">He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-14">in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-15">He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-16">for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers—all things have been created through him and for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-17">He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-18">He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-19">For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-20">and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-21">And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-22">he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him—&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-23">provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-24">I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-25">I became its servant according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-26">the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-27">To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-28">It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-29">For this I toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Philippians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Colossians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
