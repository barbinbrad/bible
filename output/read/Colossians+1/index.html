even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as  in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-7">even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-8">who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-9">For this cause we also, since the day we heard , do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-10">to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-11">strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-12">giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-13">who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-14">in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-15">who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-16">for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-17">and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-18">And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-19">For it was the good pleasure  that in him should all the fulness dwell;&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-20">and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, , whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-21">And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-22">yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Col-1-23">if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven;
