give them; and having taken possession of it, they settled there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-21-44">And the Lord gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their ancestors; not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the Lord had given all their enemies into their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-21-45">Not one of all the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5"
