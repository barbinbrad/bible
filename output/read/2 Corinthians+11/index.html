Do bear with me!&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-2">I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-3">But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-4">For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-5">I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-6">I may be untrained in speech, but not in knowledge; certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-7">Did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed God’s good news to you free of charge?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-8">I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-9">And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from Macedonia. So I refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-10">As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-11">And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-12">And what I do I will also continue to do, in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-13">For such boasters are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-14">And no wonder! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-15">So it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness. Their end will match their deeds.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-16">I repeat, let no one think that I am a fool; but if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-17">What I am saying in regard to this boastful confidence, I am saying not with the Lord’s authority, but as a fool;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-18">since many boast according to human standards, I will also boast.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-19">For you gladly put up with fools, being wise yourselves!&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-20">For you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or gives you a slap in the face.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-21">To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-22">Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-23">Are they ministers of Christ? I am talking like a madman—I am a better one: with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless floggings, and often near death.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-24">Five times I have received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-25">Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked; for a night and a day I was adrift at sea;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-26">on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from bandits, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers and sisters;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-27">in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, hungry and thirsty, often without food, cold and naked.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-28">And, besides other things, I am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I am not indignant?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-30">If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus (blessed be he forever!) knows that I do not lie.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-32">In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize me,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-33">but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Corinthians+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
