God knoweth.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-14">And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-15">It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-16">I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if , yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-17">That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-19">For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise .&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-20">For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you , if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-21">I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-22">Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-23">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-24">Of the Jews five times received I forty  save one.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-25">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-26">journeyings often,  perils of rivers,  perils of robbers,  perils from countrymen,  perils from the Gentiles,  perils in the city,  perils in the wilderness,  perils in the sea,  perils among false brethren;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-27">labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-28">Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-30">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-32">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Cor-11-33">and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Corinthians+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
