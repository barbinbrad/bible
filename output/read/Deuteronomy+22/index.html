You may not withhold your help.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-4">You shall not see your neighbor’s donkey or ox fallen on the road and ignore it; you shall help to lift it up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-5">A woman shall not wear a man’s apparel, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whoever does such things is abhorrent to the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-6">If you come on a bird’s nest, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, with the mother sitting on the fledglings or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-7">Let the mother go, taking only the young for yourself, in order that it may go well with you and you may live long.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-8">When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof; otherwise you might have bloodguilt on your house, if anyone should fall from it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-9">You shall not sow your vineyard with a second kind of seed, or the whole yield will have to be forfeited, both the crop that you have sown and the yield of the vineyard itself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-10">You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-11">You shall not wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-12">You shall make tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-13">Suppose a man marries a woman, but after going in to her, he dislikes her&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-14">and makes up charges against her, slandering her by saying, “I married this woman; but when I lay with her, I did not find evidence of her virginity.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-15">The father of the young woman and her mother shall then submit the evidence of the young woman’s virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-16">The father of the young woman shall say to the elders: “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he dislikes her;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-17">now he has made up charges against her, saying, ‘I did not find evidence of your daughter’s virginity.’ But here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity.” Then they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-18">The elders of that town shall take the man and punish him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-19">they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver (which they shall give to the young woman’s father) because he has slandered a virgin of Israel.

So you shall purge the evil from your midst.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-25">But if the man meets the engaged woman in the open country, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-26">You shall do nothing to the young woman; the young woman has not committed an offense punishable by death, because this case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-27">Since he found her in the open country, the engaged woman may have cried for help, but there was no one to rescue her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-28">If a man meets a virgin who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are caught in the act,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-22-29">the man who lay with her shall give fifty shekels of silver to the young woman’s father, and she shall become his wife.
