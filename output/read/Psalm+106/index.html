Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness  for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-2">Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-3">Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-4">Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-5">That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-6">We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-7">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-8">Nevertheless he saved them for his nameâ€™s sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-9">He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-10">And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-11">And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-12">Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-13">They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-15">And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-16">They envied Moses also in the camp,  Aaron the saint of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-18">And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-19">They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-20">Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-21">They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham,  terrible things by the Red Sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy .&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-24">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-25">But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-26">Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-27">And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-28">They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-29">Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-30">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-31">And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-32">They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-33">Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-34">They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-35">But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-36">And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-38">And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-39">Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-40">Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-41">And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-42">Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-43">Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-44">Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-45">And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-46">He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-47">Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-106-48">Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+105/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+107/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
