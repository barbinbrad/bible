There, at the entrance of the gateway, were twenty-five men; among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, officials of the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-2">He said to me, “Mortal, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-3">they say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the pot, and we are the meat.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-4">Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O mortal.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-5">Then the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the Lord: This is what you think, O house of Israel; I know the things that come into your mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-6">You have killed many in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-7">Therefore thus says the Lord God: The slain whom you have placed within it are the meat, and this city is the pot; but you shall be taken out of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-8">You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-9">I will take you out of it and give you over to the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-10">You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-11">This city shall not be your pot, and you shall not be the meat inside it; I will judge you at the border of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-12">Then you shall know that I am the Lord, whose statutes you have not followed, and whose ordinances you have not kept, but you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are around you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-13">Now, while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord God! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-14">Then the word of the Lord came to me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-15">Mortal, your kinsfolk, your own kin, your fellow exiles, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, “They have gone far from the Lord; to us this land is given for a possession.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-16">Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: Though I removed them far away among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have gone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-17">Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-18">When they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-19">I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-20">so that they may follow my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-21">But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-22">Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-23">And the glory of the Lord ascended from the middle of the city, and stopped on the mountain east of the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-24">The spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen left me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ezek-11-25">And I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ezekiel+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
