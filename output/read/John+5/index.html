Now that day was a sabbath. &nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-9">So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, “It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-10">But he answered them, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-11">They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take it up and walk’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-12">Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-13">Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-14">The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-15">Therefore the Jews started persecuting Jesus, because he was doing such things on the sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-16">But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, and I also am working.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-17">For this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because he was not only breaking the sabbath, but was also calling God his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-18">Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-19">The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will show him greater works than these, so that you will be astonished.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-20">Indeed, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-21">The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-22">so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-23">Very truly, I tell you, anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and does not come under judgment, but has passed from death to life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-24">“Very truly, I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-25">For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-26">and he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-27">Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-28">and will come out—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-29">“I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-30">“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-31">There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony to me is true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-32">You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-33">Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that you may be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-34">He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-35">But I have a testimony greater than John’s. The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-36">And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-37">and you do not have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe him whom he has sent.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-38">“You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-39">Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-40">I do not accept glory from human beings.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-41">But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-42">I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name, you will accept him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-43">How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-44">Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-45">If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-5-46">But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
