Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-8">“If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-9">And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-10">“Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-11">What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-12">And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-13">So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-14">“If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-15">But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-16">If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-17">Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-18">Again, truly I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-19">For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-20">Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-21">Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-22">“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-23">When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-24">and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-25">So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-26">And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-27">But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-28">Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-29">But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-30">When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-31">Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-32">Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-33">And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-18-34">So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
