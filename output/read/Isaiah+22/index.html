What do you mean that you have gone up, all of you, to the housetops,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-2">you that are full of shoutings, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain by the sword, nor are they dead in battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-3">Your rulers have all fled together; they were captured without the use of a bow. All of you who were found were captured, though they had fled far away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-4">Therefore I said: Look away from me, let me weep bitter tears; do not try to comfort me for the destruction of my beloved people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-5">For the Lord God of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a battering down of walls and a cry for help to the mountains.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-6">Elam bore the quiver with chariots and cavalry, and Kir uncovered the shield.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-7">Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the cavalry took their stand at the gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-8">He has taken away the covering of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest, &nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-9">and you saw that there were many breaches in the city of David, and you collected the waters of the lower pool.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-10">You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-11">You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or have regard for him who planned it long ago.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-12">In that day the Lord God of hosts called to weeping and mourning, to baldness and putting on sackcloth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-13">but instead there was joy and festivity, killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, eating meat and drinking wine. “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-14">The Lord of hosts has revealed himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die, says the Lord God of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-15">Thus says the Lord God of hosts: Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is master of the household, and say to him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-16">What right do you have here? Who are your relatives here, that you have cut out a tomb here for yourself, cutting a tomb on the height, and carving a habitation for yourself in the rock?&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-17">The Lord is about to hurl you away violently, my fellow. He will seize firm hold on you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-18">whirl you round and round, and throw you like a ball into a wide land; there you shall die, and there your splendid chariots shall lie, O you disgrace to your master’s house!&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-19">I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your post.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-20">On that day I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-21">and will clothe him with your robe and bind your sash on him. I will commit your authority to his hand, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-22">I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and no one shall shut; he shall shut, and no one shall open.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-23">I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his ancestral house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-24">And they will hang on him the whole weight of his ancestral house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-22-25">On that day, says the Lord of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way; it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will perish, for the Lord has spoken.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Isaiah+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Isaiah+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
