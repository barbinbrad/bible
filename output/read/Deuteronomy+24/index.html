or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-4">her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-5">When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-6">No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh  life to pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-7">If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-8">Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-9">Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-10">When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-11">Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-12">And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-13">thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-14">Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates:&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-15">in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it (for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it); lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-16">The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-17">Thou shalt not wrest the justice  to the sojourner,  to the fatherless, nor take the widow’s raiment to pledge;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-18">but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-24-19">When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow;
