Why have you stolen my silver cup?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-5">Is it not from this that my lord drinks? Does he not indeed use it for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-6">When he overtook them, he repeated these words to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-7">They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-8">Look, the money that we found at the top of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; why then would we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-9">Should it be found with any one of your servants, let him die; moreover the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-10">He said, “Even so; in accordance with your words, let it be: he with whom it is found shall become my slave, but the rest of you shall go free.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-11">Then each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-12">He searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-13">At this they tore their clothes. Then each one loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-14">Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house while he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-15">Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that one such as I can practice divination?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-16">And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; here we are then, my lord’s slaves, both we and also the one in whose possession the cup has been found.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-17">But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the one in whose possession the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-18">Then Judah stepped up to him and said, “O my lord, let your servant please speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-19">My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-20">And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead; he alone is left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-21">Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, so that I may set my eyes on him.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-22">We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-23">Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-24">When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-25">And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-26">we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother goes with us, will we go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-27">Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-28">one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-29">If you take this one also from me, and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-30">Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy’s life,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-31">when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-32">For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-33">Now therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord in place of the boy; and let the boy go back with his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-34">For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the suffering that would come upon my father.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+43/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+45/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
