And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-4">when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-5">Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-6">And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-7">And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-8">Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-9">With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-10">And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-11">Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-12">And he searched,  began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-13">Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-14">And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-15">And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-16">And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-17">And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-18">Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-20">And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-21">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-22">And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-23">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-24">And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-25">And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-27">And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-28">and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-29">and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-30">Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-31">it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not , that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-32">For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-33">Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-44-34">For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+43/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+45/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
