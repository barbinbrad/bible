And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-4">And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-5">And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-6">And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-7">and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-8">But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-9">For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-10">and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-11">And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-12">And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-13">And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-14">And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-15">But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-16">But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-17">And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-18">And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-19">And not finding by what  they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-20">And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-22">But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-23">Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-24">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-25">And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-26">And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-27">And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-28">And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-29">And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-30">And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-31">And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-32">I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-33">And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the  of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-34">And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-35">But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-36">And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-37">And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-38">But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-5-39">And no man having drunk old  desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
