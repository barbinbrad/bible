And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-2">And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-3">Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-4">and it came to pass, as he sowed, some  fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-5">And other fell on the rocky , where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-6">and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-7">And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-8">And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-9">And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-11">And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-12">that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-13">And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-14">The sower soweth the word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-15">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-16">And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky , who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-17">and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-18">And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-19">and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-20">And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-21">And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed,  not to be put on the stand?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-22">For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was  made secret, but that it should come to light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-23">If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-24">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-25">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-27">and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-28">The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-29">But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-30">And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-32">yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-33">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-34">and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-35">And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-36">And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-37">And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-38">And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-39">And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-40">And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-4-41">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
