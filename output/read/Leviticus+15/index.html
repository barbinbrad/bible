and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-5">Anyone who touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-6">All who sit on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-7">All who touch the body of the one with the discharge shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-8">If the one with the discharge spits on persons who are clean, then they shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-9">Any saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-10">All who touch anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening, and all who carry such a thing shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-11">All those whom the one with the discharge touches without his having rinsed his hands in water shall wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-12">Any earthen vessel that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-13">When the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, he shall count seven days for his cleansing; he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in fresh water, and he shall be clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-14">On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the Lord to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-15">The priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the Lord for his discharge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-16">If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-17">Everything made of cloth or of skin on which the semen falls shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-18">If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-19">When a woman has a discharge of blood that is her regular discharge from her body, she shall be in her impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-20">Everything upon which she lies during her impurity shall be unclean; everything also upon which she sits shall be unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-21">Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-22">Whoever touches anything upon which she sits shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-23">whether it is the bed or anything upon which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-24">If any man lies with her, and her impurity falls on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-25">If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness; as in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-26">Every bed on which she lies during all the days of her discharge shall be treated as the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-27">Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-28">If she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count seven days, and after that she shall be clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-29">On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-15-30">The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering;
