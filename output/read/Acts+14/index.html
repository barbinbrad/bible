And Paul, looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-10">said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And the man sprang up and began to walk.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-11">When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-12">Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-13">The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates; he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-14">When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-15">“Friends, why are you doing this? We are mortals just like you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-16">In past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-17">yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing good—giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, and filling you with food and your hearts with joy.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-18">Even with these words, they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-19">But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. Then they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-20">But when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-21">After they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, then on to Iconium and Antioch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-22">There they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith, saying, “It is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-23">And after they had appointed elders for them in each church, with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had come to believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-24">Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-25">When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-26">From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-27">When they arrived, they called the church together and related all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-14-28">And they stayed there with the disciples for some time.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
