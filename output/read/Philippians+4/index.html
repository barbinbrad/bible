The Lord is near.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-6">Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-7">And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-8">Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-9">Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-10">I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned for me, but had no opportunity to show it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-11">Not that I am referring to being in need; for I have learned to be content with whatever I have.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-12">I know what it is to have little, and I know what it is to have plenty. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being well-fed and of going hungry, of having plenty and of being in need.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-13">I can do all things through him who strengthens me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-14">In any case, it was kind of you to share my distress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-15">You Philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-16">For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me help for my needs more than once.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-17">Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that accumulates to your account.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-18">I have been paid in full and have more than enough; I am fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-19">And my God will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-20">To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Phil-4-21">Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
