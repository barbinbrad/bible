It had two horns. Both horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up second.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-4">I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. All beasts were powerless to withstand it, and no one could rescue from its power; it did as it pleased and became strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-5">As I was watching, a male goat appeared from the west, coming across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground. The goat had a horn between its eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-6">It came toward the ram with the two horns that I had seen standing beside the river, and it ran at it with savage force.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-7">I saw it approaching the ram. It was enraged against it and struck the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram did not have power to withstand it; it threw the ram down to the ground and trampled upon it, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from its power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-8">Then the male goat grew exceedingly great; but at the height of its power, the great horn was broken, and in its place there came up four prominent horns toward the four winds of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-9">Out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-10">It grew as high as the host of heaven. It threw down to the earth some of the host and some of the stars, and trampled on them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-11">Even against the prince of the host it acted arrogantly; it took the regular burnt offering away from him and overthrew the place of his sanctuary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-12">Because of wickedness, the host was given over to it together with the regular burnt offering; it cast truth to the ground, and kept prospering in what it did.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-13">Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one that spoke, “For how long is this vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-14">And he answered him, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-15">When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I tried to understand it. Then someone appeared standing before me, having the appearance of a man,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-16">and I heard a human voice by the Ulai, calling, “Gabriel, help this man understand the vision.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I became frightened and fell prostrate. But he said to me, “Understand, O mortal, that the vision is for the time of the end.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-18">As he was speaking to me, I fell into a trance, face to the ground; then he touched me and set me on my feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-19">He said, “Listen, and I will tell you what will take place later in the period of wrath; for it refers to the appointed time of the end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-20">As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-21">The male goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between its eyes is the first king.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-22">As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-23">At the end of their rule, when the transgressions have reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance shall arise, skilled in intrigue.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-24">He shall grow strong in power, shall cause fearful destruction, and shall succeed in what he does. He shall destroy the powerful and the people of the holy ones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-25">By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall be great. Without warning he shall destroy many and shall even rise up against the Prince of princes. But he shall be broken, and not by human hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-26">The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true. As for you, seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-8-27">So I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I arose and went about the king’s business. But I was dismayed by the vision and did not understand it.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Daniel+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Daniel+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
