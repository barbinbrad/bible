While they were searching for Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly, they attacked Jason’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-6">When they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some believers before the city authorities, shouting, “These people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-7">and Jason has entertained them as guests. They are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor, saying that there is another king named Jesus.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-8">The people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-9">and after they had taken bail from Jason and the others, they let them go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-10">That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and when they arrived, they went to the Jewish synagogue.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-11">These Jews were more receptive than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-12">Many of them therefore believed, including not a few Greek women and men of high standing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea as well, they came there too, to stir up and incite the crowds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-14">Then the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-15">Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-17">So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-18">Also some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers debated with him. Some said, “What does this babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-19">So they took him and brought him to the Areopagus and asked him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-20">It sounds rather strange to us, so we would like to know what it means.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-21">Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-22">Then Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-23">For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-24">The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-25">nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-26">From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-27">so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-28">For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we too are his offspring.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-29">Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-30">While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-31">because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-32">When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; but others said, “We will hear you again about this.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-33">At that point Paul left them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-17-34">But some of them joined him and became believers, including Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
