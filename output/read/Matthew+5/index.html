It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-14">“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-15">No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-16">In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-17">“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-18">For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-19">Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-20">For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-21">“You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not murder’; and ‘whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-22">But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be liable to the council; and if you say, ‘You fool,’ you will be liable to the hell of fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-23">So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-24">leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-25">Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-26">Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-27">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-28">But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-29">If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-30">And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-31">“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-32">But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-33">“Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-34">But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-35">or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-36">And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-37">Let your word be ‘Yes, Yes’ or ‘No, No’; anything more than this comes from the evil one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-38">“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-39">But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-40">and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-41">and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-42">Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-43">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-44">But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-45">so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-46">For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-47">And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-5-48">Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
