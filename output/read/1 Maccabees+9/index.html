We may have the strength to fight them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-9">But they tried to dissuade him, saying, “We do not have the strength. Let us rather save our own lives now, and let us come back with our kindred and fight them; we are too few.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-10">But Judas said, “Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our kindred, and leave no cause to question our honor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-11">Then the army of Bacchides marched out from the camp and took its stand for the encounter. The cavalry was divided into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army, as did all the chief warriors.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-12">Bacchides was on the right wing. Flanked by the two companies, the phalanx advanced to the sound of the trumpets; and the men with Judas also blew their trumpets.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-13">The earth was shaken by the noise of the armies, and the battle raged from morning until evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-14">Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right; then all the stouthearted men went with him,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-15">and they crushed the right wing, and he pursued them as far as Mount Azotus.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-16">When those on the left wing saw that the right wing was crushed, they turned and followed close behind Judas and his men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-17">The battle became desperate, and many on both sides were wounded and fell.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-18">Judas also fell, and the rest fled.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-19">Then Jonathan and Simon took their brother Judas and buried him in the tomb of their ancestors at Modein,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-20">and wept for him. All Israel made great lamentation for him; they mourned many days and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-21">“How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-22">Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars and the brave deeds that he did, and his greatness, have not been recorded, but they were very many.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-23">After the death of Judas, the renegades emerged in all parts of Israel; all the wrongdoers reappeared.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-24">In those days a very great famine occurred, and the country went over to their side.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-25">Bacchides chose the godless and put them in charge of the country.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-26">They made inquiry and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, who took vengeance on them and made sport of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-27">So there was great distress in Israel, such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-28">Then all the friends of Judas assembled and said to Jonathan,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-29">“Since the death of your brother Judas there has been no one like him to go against our enemies and Bacchides, and to deal with those of our nation who hate us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-30">Now therefore we have chosen you today to take his place as our ruler and leader, to fight our battle.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-31">So Jonathan accepted the leadership at that time in place of his brother Judas.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-32">When Bacchides learned of this, he tried to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-33">But Jonathan and his brother Simon and all who were with him heard of it, and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoa and camped by the water of the pool of Asphar.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-34">Bacchides found this out on the sabbath day, and he with all his army crossed the Jordan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-35">So Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude and begged the Nabateans, who were his friends, for permission to store with them the great amount of baggage that they had.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-36">But the family of Jambri from Medeba came out and seized John and all that he had, and left with it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-37">After these things it was reported to Jonathan and his brother Simon, “The family of Jambri are celebrating a great wedding, and are conducting the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan, from Nadabath with a large escort.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-38">Remembering how their brother John had been killed, they went up and hid under cover of the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-39">They looked out and saw a tumultuous procession with a great amount of baggage; and the bridegroom came out with his friends and his brothers to meet them with tambourines and musicians and many weapons.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-40">Then they rushed on them from the ambush and began killing them. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled to the mountain; and the Jews took all their goods.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-41">So the wedding was turned into mourning and the voice of their musicians into a funeral dirge.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-42">After they had fully avenged the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the Jordan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-43">When Bacchides heard of this, he came with a large force on the sabbath day to the banks of the Jordan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-44">And Jonathan said to those with him, “Let us get up now and fight for our lives, for today things are not as they were before.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-45">For look! the battle is in front of us and behind us; the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that, with marsh and thicket; there is no place to turn.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-46">Cry out now to Heaven that you may be delivered from the hands of our enemies.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-47">So the battle began, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacchides, but he eluded him and went to the rear.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-48">Then Jonathan and the men with him leaped into the Jordan and swam across to the other side, and the enemy did not cross the Jordan to attack them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-49">And about one thousand of Bacchides’ men fell that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-50">Then Bacchides returned to Jerusalem and built strong cities in Judea: the fortress in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Beth-horon, and Bethel, and Timnath, and Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-51">And he placed garrisons in them to harass Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-52">He also fortified the town of Beth-zur, and Gazara, and the citadel, and in them he put troops and stores of food.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-53">And he took the sons of the leading men of the land as hostages and put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-54">In the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary. He tore down the work of the prophets!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-55">But he only began to tear it down, for at that time Alcimus was stricken and his work was hindered; his mouth was stopped and he was paralyzed, so that he could no longer say a word or give commands concerning his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-56">And Alcimus died at that time in great agony.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-57">When Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king, and the land of Judah had rest for two years.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-58">Then all the lawless plotted and said, “See! Jonathan and his men are living in quiet and confidence. So now let us bring Bacchides back, and he will capture them all in one night.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-59">And they went and consulted with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-60">He started to come with a large force, and secretly sent letters to all his allies in Judea, telling them to seize Jonathan and his men; but they were unable to do it, because their plan became known.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-61">And Jonathan’s men seized about fifty of the men of the country who were leaders in this treachery, and killed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-62">Then Jonathan with his men, and Simon, withdrew to Bethbasi in the wilderness; he rebuilt the parts of it that had been demolished, and they fortified it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-63">When Bacchides learned of this, he assembled all his forces, and sent orders to the men of Judea.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-64">Then he came and encamped against Bethbasi; he fought against it for many days and made machines of war.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-65">But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the town, while he went out into the country; and he went with only a few men.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-66">He struck down Odomera and his kindred and the people of Phasiron in their tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-67">Then he began to attack and went into battle with his forces; and Simon and his men sallied out from the town and set fire to the machines of war.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-68">They fought with Bacchides, and he was crushed by them. They pressed him very hard, for his plan and his expedition had been in vain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-69">So he was very angry at the renegades who had counseled him to come into the country, and he killed many of them. Then he decided to go back to his own land.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-70">When Jonathan learned of this, he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with him and obtain release of the captives.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-71">He agreed, and did as he said; and he swore to Jonathan that he would not try to harm him as long as he lived.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-72">He restored to him the captives whom he had taken previously from the land of Judah; then he turned and went back to his own land, and did not come again into their territory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-9-73">Thus the sword ceased from Israel. Jonathan settled in Michmash and began to judge the people; and he destroyed the godless out of Israel.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
