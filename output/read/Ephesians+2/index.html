it is the gift of God—&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-9">not the result of works, so that no one may boast.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-10">For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-11">So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called “the uncircumcision” by those who are called “the circumcision”—a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands—&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-12">remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-14">For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-15">He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-16">and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-17">So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-18">for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-19">So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-20">built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-21">In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord;&nbsp;</span><span id="Eph-2-22">in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Ephesians+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ephesians+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
