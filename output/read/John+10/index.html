He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-4">When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-5">They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-6">Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-7">So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-8">All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-9">I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-10">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-11">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-12">The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-13">The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-14">I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-16">I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-17">For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-18">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-19">Again the Jews were divided because of these words.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-20">Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why listen to him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-21">Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-22">At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-23">and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-24">So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-25">Jesus answered, “I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name testify to me;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-26">but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-27">My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-28">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-29">What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-30">The Father and I are one.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-31">The Jews took up stones again to stone him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-32">Jesus replied, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-33">The Jews answered, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, though only a human being, are making yourself God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-34">Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-35">If those to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’—and the scripture cannot be annulled—&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-36">can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-37">If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-38">But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-39">Then they tried to arrest him again, but he escaped from their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-40">He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-41">Many came to him, and they were saying, “John performed no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-42">And many believed in him there.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
