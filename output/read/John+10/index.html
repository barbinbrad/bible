I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-19">There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-20">And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-21">Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-22">And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-23">it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-24">The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-26">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-28">and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-29">My Father, who hath given  unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch  out of the Father’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-30">I and the Father are one.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-31">The Jews took up stones again to stone him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-33">The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-35">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-36">say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am  Son of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-38">But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-39">They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-40">And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-41">And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-10-42">And many believed on him there.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
