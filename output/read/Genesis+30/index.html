For the women will call me happy”; so she named him Asher.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-14">In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-15">But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-16">When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-17">And God heeded Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-18">Leah said, “God has given me my hire because I gave my maid to my husband”; so she named him Issachar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-19">And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-20">Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons”; so she named him Zebulun.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-21">Afterwards she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-22">Then God remembered Rachel, and God heeded her and opened her womb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-23">She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach”;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-24">and she named him Joseph, saying, “May the Lord add to me another son!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-25">When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-26">Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know very well the service I have given you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-27">But Laban said to him, “If you will allow me to say so, I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-28">name your wages, and I will give it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-29">Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-30">For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly; and the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-31">He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-32">let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-33">So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-34">Laban said, “Good! Let it be as you have said.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-35">But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-36">and he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was pasturing the rest of Laban’s flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-37">Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-38">He set the rods that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-39">the flocks bred in front of the rods, and so the flocks produced young that were striped, speckled, and spotted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-40">Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the completely black animals in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-41">Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-42">but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-30-43">Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+29/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
