But say in your heart, “It is you, O Lord, whom we must worship.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-7">For my angel is with you, and he is watching over your lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-8">Their tongues are smoothed by the carpenter, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and silver; but they are false and cannot speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-9">People take gold and make crowns for the heads of their gods, as they might for a girl who loves ornaments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-10">Sometimes the priests secretly take gold and silver from their gods and spend it on themselves,&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-11">or even give some of it to the prostitutes on the terrace. They deck their gods out with garments like human beings—these gods of silver and gold and wood&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-12">that cannot save themselves from rust and corrosion. When they have been dressed in purple robes,&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-13">their faces are wiped because of the dust from the temple, which is thick upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-14">One of them holds a scepter, like a district judge, but is unable to destroy anyone who offends it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-15">Another has a dagger in its right hand, and an ax, but cannot defend itself from war and robbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-16">From this it is evident that they are not gods; so do not fear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-17">For just as someone’s dish is useless when it is broken,&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-18">so are their gods when they have been set up in the temples. Their eyes are full of the dust raised by the feet of those who enter. And just as the gates are shut on every side against anyone who has offended a king, as though under sentence of death, so the priests make their temples secure with doors and locks and bars, in order that they may not be plundered by robbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-19">They light more lamps for them than they light for themselves, though their gods can see none of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-20">They are just like a beam of the temple, but their hearts, it is said, are eaten away when crawling creatures from the earth devour them and their robes. They do not notice&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-21">when their faces have been blackened by the smoke of the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-22">Bats, swallows, and birds alight on their bodies and heads; and so do cats.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-23">From this you will know that they are not gods; so do not fear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-24">As for the gold that they wear for beauty—it will not shine unless someone wipes off the tarnish; for even when they were being cast, they did not feel it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-25">They are bought without regard to cost, but there is no breath in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-26">Having no feet, they are carried on the shoulders of others, revealing to humankind their worthlessness. And those who serve them are put to shame&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-27">because, if any of these gods falls to the ground, they themselves must pick it up. If anyone sets it upright, it cannot move itself; and if it is tipped over, it cannot straighten itself. Gifts are placed before them just as before the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-28">The priests sell the sacrifices that are offered to these gods and use the money themselves. Likewise their wives preserve some of the meat with salt, but give none to the poor or helpless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-29">Sacrifices to them may even be touched by women in their periods or at childbirth. Since you know by these things that they are not gods, do not fear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-30">For how can they be called gods? Women serve meals for gods of silver and gold and wood;&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-31">and in their temples the priests sit with their clothes torn, their heads and beards shaved, and their heads uncovered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-32">They howl and shout before their gods as some do at a funeral banquet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-33">The priests take some of the clothing of their gods to clothe their wives and children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-34">Whether one does evil to them or good, they will not be able to repay it. They cannot set up a king or depose one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-35">Likewise they are not able to give either wealth or money; if one makes a vow to them and does not keep it, they will not require it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-36">They cannot save anyone from death or rescue the weak from the strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-37">They cannot restore sight to the blind; they cannot rescue one who is in distress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-38">They cannot take pity on a widow or do good to an orphan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-39">These things that are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver are like stones from the mountain, and those who serve them will be put to shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-40">Why then must anyone think that they are gods, or call them gods? Besides, even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them; for when they see someone who cannot speak, they bring Bel and pray that the mute may speak, as though Bel were able to understand! &nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-41">Yet they themselves cannot perceive this and abandon them, for they have no sense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-42">And the women, with cords around them, sit along the passageways, burning bran for incense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-43">When one of them is led off by one of the passers-by and is taken to bed by him, she derides the woman next to her, because she was not as attractive as herself and her cord was not broken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-44">Whatever is done for these idols is false. Why then must anyone think that they are gods, or call them gods?&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-45">They are made by carpenters and goldsmiths; they can be nothing but what the artisans wish them to be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-46">Those who make them will certainly not live very long themselves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-47">how then can the things that are made by them be gods? They have left only lies and reproach for those who come after.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-48">For when war or calamity comes upon them, the priests consult together as to where they can hide themselves and their gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-49">How then can one fail to see that these are not gods, for they cannot save themselves from war or calamity?&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-50">Since they are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it will afterward be known that they are false.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-51">It will be manifest to all the nations and kings that they are not gods but the work of human hands, and that there is no work of God in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-52">Who then can fail to know that they are not gods?&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-53">For they cannot set up a king over a country or give rain to people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-54">They cannot judge their own cause or deliver one who is wronged, for they have no power;&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-55">they are like crows between heaven and earth. When fire breaks out in a temple of wooden gods overlaid with gold or silver, their priests will flee and escape, but the gods will be burned up like timbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-56">Besides, they can offer no resistance to king or enemy. Why then must anyone admit or think that they are gods?&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-57">Gods made of wood and overlaid with silver and gold are unable to save themselves from thieves or robbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-58">Anyone who can will strip them of their gold and silver and of the robes they wear, and go off with this booty, and they will not be able to help themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-59">So it is better to be a king who shows his courage, or a household utensil that serves its owner’s need, than to be these false gods; better even the door of a house that protects its contents, than these false gods; better also a wooden pillar in a palace, than these false gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-60">For sun and moon and stars are bright, and when sent to do a service, they are obedient.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-61">So also the lightning, when it flashes, is widely seen; and the wind likewise blows in every land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-62">When God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they carry out his command.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-63">And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does what it is ordered. But these idols are not to be compared with them in appearance or power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-64">Therefore one must not think that they are gods, nor call them gods, for they are not able either to decide a case or to do good to anyone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-65">Since you know then that they are not gods, do not fear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-66">They can neither curse nor bless kings;&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-67">they cannot show signs in the heavens for the nations, or shine like the sun or give light like the moon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-68">The wild animals are better than they are, for they can flee to shelter and help themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-69">So we have no evidence whatever that they are gods; therefore do not fear them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-70">Like a scarecrow in a cucumber bed, which guards nothing, so are their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-71">In the same way, their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver, are like a thornbush in a garden on which every bird perches; or like a corpse thrown out in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-72">From the purple and linen that rot upon them you will know that they are not gods; and they will finally be consumed themselves, and be a reproach in the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Bar-6-73">Better, therefore, is someone upright who has no idols; such a person will be far above reproach.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Baruch+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Ezekiel+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
