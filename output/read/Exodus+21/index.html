He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-7">When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-8">If she does not please her master, who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed; he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt unfairly with her.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-9">If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-10">If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-11">And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out without debt, without payment of money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-12">Whoever strikes a person mortally shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-13">If it was not premeditated, but came about by an act of God, then I will appoint for you a place to which the killer may flee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-14">But if someone willfully attacks and kills another by treachery, you shall take the killer from my altar for execution.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-15">Whoever strikes father or mother shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-16">Whoever kidnaps a person, whether that person has been sold or is still held in possession, shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-17">Whoever curses father or mother shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-18">When individuals quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or fist so that the injured party, though not dead, is confined to bed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-19">but recovers and walks around outside with the help of a staff, then the assailant shall be free of liability, except to pay for the loss of time, and to arrange for full recovery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-20">When a slaveowner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-21">But if the slave survives a day or two, there is no punishment; for the slave is the owner’s property.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-22">When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman’s husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-23">If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-24">eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-25">burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-26">When a slaveowner strikes the eye of a male or female slave, destroying it, the owner shall let the slave go, a free person, to compensate for the eye.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-27">If the owner knocks out a tooth of a male or female slave, the slave shall be let go, a free person, to compensate for the tooth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-21-28">When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten;
