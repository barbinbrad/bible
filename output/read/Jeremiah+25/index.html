but ye have not hearkened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-4">And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear),&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-5">saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-6">and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-7">Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-8">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-9">behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and  unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-10">Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-11">And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-12">And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-13">And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-14">For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-15">For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-16">And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-17">Then took I the cup at Jehovahâ€™s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-18">, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-19">Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-20">and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-21">Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-22">and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-23">Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners  cut off;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-24">and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-25">and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-26">and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-27">And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-28">And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-29">For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-30">Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread , against all the inhabitants of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-31">A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-32">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-33">And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-34">Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow , ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-35">And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-36">A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-37">And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jer-25-38">He hath left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing , and because of his fierce anger.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Jeremiah+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Jeremiah+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
