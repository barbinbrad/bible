And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-2">And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-3">But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-4">They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-5">And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-6">And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-7">For  many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-8">And there was much joy in that city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-9">But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-10">to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-11">And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-12">But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-13">And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-14">Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-15">who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-16">for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-18">Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-19">saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-20">But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-23">For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-24">And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-25">They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-26">But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-27">And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-28">and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-29">And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-30">And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-31">And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-32">Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-35">And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-36">And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold,  water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-37">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-38">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-39">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
