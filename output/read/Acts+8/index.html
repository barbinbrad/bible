That day a severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria. &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-2">Devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-3">But Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house; dragging off both men and women, he committed them to prison.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-4">Now those who were scattered went from place to place, proclaiming the word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-5">Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-6">The crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by Philip, hearing and seeing the signs that he did,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-7">for unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, came out of many who were possessed; and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-8">So there was great joy in that city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-9">Now a certain man named Simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-10">All of them, from the least to the greatest, listened to him eagerly, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-11">And they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-12">But when they believed Philip, who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-13">Even Simon himself believed. After being baptized, he stayed constantly with Philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-14">Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-15">The two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-16">(for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus).&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-17">Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-18">Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-19">saying, “Give me also this power so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-20">But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God’s gift with money!&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-21">You have no part or share in this, for your heart is not right before God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-22">Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-23">For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-24">Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-25">Now after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-26">Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a wilderness road.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-27">So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-28">and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-29">Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-30">So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-31">He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-32">Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this: “Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-33">In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-34">The eunuch asked Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-35">Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-36">As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-37">He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-38">When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-8-39">But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
