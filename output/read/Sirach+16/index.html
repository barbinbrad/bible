For mercy and wrath are with the Lord; he is mighty to forgive—but he also pours out wrath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-12">Great as is his mercy, so also is his chastisement; he judges a person according to his or her deeds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-13">The sinner will not escape with plunder, and the patience of the godly will not be frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-14">He makes room for every act of mercy; everyone receives in accordance with his or her deeds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-15">Do not say, “I am hidden from the Lord, and who from on high has me in mind? Among so many people I am unknown, for what am I in a boundless creation?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-16">Lo, heaven and the highest heaven, the abyss and the earth, tremble at his visitation!&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-17">The very mountains and the foundations of the earth quiver and quake when he looks upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-18">But no human mind can grasp this, and who can comprehend his ways?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-19">Like a tempest that no one can see, so most of his works are concealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-20">Who is to announce his acts of justice? Or who can await them? For his decree is far off.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-21">Such are the thoughts of one devoid of understanding; a senseless and misguided person thinks foolishly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-22">Listen to me, my child, and acquire knowledge, and pay close attention to my words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-23">I will impart discipline precisely and declare knowledge accurately.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-24">When the Lord created his works from the beginning, and, in making them, determined their boundaries,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-25">he arranged his works in an eternal order, and their dominion for all generations. They neither hunger nor grow weary, and they do not abandon their tasks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-26">They do not crowd one another, and they never disobey his word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-27">Then the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his good things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-16-28">With all kinds of living beings he covered its surface, and into it they must return.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
