When they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-5">But as one was felling a log, his ax head fell into the water; he cried out, “Alas, master! It was borrowed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-6">Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-7">He said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-8">Once when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he took counsel with his officers. He said, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-9">But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Take care not to pass this place, because the Arameans are going down there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-10">The king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God spoke. More than once or twice he warned such a place so that it was on the alert.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-11">The mind of the king of Aram was greatly perturbed because of this; he called his officers and said to them, “Now tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-12">Then one of his officers said, “No one, my lord king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-13">He said, “Go and find where he is; I will send and seize him.” He was told, “He is in Dothan.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-14">So he sent horses and chariots there and a great army; they came by night, and surrounded the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-15">When an attendant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. His servant said, “Alas, master! What shall we do?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-16">He replied, “Do not be afraid, for there are more with us than there are with them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-17">Then Elisha prayed: “O Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-18">When the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and said, “Strike this people, please, with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-19">Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-20">As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they may see.” The Lord opened their eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-21">When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, “Father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-22">He answered, “No! Did you capture with your sword and your bow those whom you want to kill? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink; and let them go to their master.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-23">So he prepared for them a great feast; after they ate and drank, he sent them on their way, and they went to their master. And the Arameans no longer came raiding into the land of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-24">Some time later King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army; he marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-25">As the siege continued, famine in Samaria became so great that a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-26">Now as the king of Israel was walking on the city wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help, my lord king!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-27">He said, “No! Let the Lord help you. How can I help you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press?”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-28">But then the king asked her, “What is your complaint?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son; we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-29">So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son and we will eat him.’ But she has hidden her son.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-30">When the king heard the words of the woman he tore his clothes—now since he was walking on the city wall, the people could see that he had sackcloth on his body underneath—&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-31">and he said, “So may God do to me, and more, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat stays on his shoulders today.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-32">So he dispatched a man from his presence. Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Are you aware that this murderer has sent someone to take off my head? When the messenger comes, see that you shut the door and hold it closed against him. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?” &nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-6-33">While he was still speaking with them, the king came down to him and said, “This trouble is from the Lord! Why should I hope in the Lord any longer?”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Kings+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Kings+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
