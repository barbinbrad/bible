By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-2">God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-3">“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-4">But what is the divine reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-5">So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-6">But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-7">What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-8">as it is written, “God gave them a sluggish spirit, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-9">And David says, “Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-10">let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-11">So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-12">Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-14">in order to make my own people jealous, and thus save some of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-16">If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; and if the root is holy, then the branches also are holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-18">do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-19">You will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-20">That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-22">Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-23">And even those of Israel, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-24">For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-25">So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-26">And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, “Out of Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-27">“And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-28">As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-29">for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-30">Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-31">so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-32">For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-33">O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-34">“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-35">“Or who has given a gift to him, to receive a gift in return?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-36">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
