God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-2">God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-4">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-6">But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-7">What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-8">according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-9">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-11">I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation  unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-12">Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-13">But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-14">if by any means I may provoke to jealousy  my flesh, and may save some of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-15">For if the casting away of them  the reconciling of the world, what  the receiving , but life from the dead?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-16">And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-18">glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-19">Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-20">Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-21">for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-22">Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-23">And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-24">For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural , be grafted into their own olive tree?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-25">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-26">and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-27">And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-28">As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-29">For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-30">For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-31">even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-32">For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-34">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-35">or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-11-36">For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him  the glory for ever. Amen.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
