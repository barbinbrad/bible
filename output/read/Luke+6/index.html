and he spent the night in prayer to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-13">And when day came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-14">Simon, whom he named Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James, and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-15">and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who was called the Zealot,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-16">and Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-17">He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-18">They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-19">And all in the crowd were trying to touch him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-20">Then he looked up at his disciples and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-21">“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. “Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-22">“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-23">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-24">“But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-25">“Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry. “Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-26">“Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-27">“But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-28">bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-29">If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-30">Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-31">Do to others as you would have them do to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-32">“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-33">If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-34">If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-35">But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-36">Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-37">“Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-38">give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-39">He also told them a parable: “Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-40">A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-41">Why do you see the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-42">Or how can you say to your neighbor, ‘Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor’s eye.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-43">“No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-44">for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-45">The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-46">“Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-47">I will show you what someone is like who comes to me, hears my words, and acts on them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-48">That one is like a man building a house, who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when a flood arose, the river burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-49">But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it, immediately it fell, and great was the ruin of that house.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
