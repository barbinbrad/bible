And he arose and stood forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-9">And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-10">And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did : and his hand was restored.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-11">But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-12">And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-13">And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-14">Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-15">and Matthew and Thomas, and James  of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-16">and Judas  of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-17">and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-18">and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-19">And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed  all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-20">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed  ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-21">Blessed  ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed  ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-22">Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you , and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-23">Rejoice in that day, and leap : for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-24">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-25">Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe , ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-26">Woe , when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-27">But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-28">bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-29">To him that smiteth thee on the  cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-30">Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-31">And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-32">And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-33">And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-34">And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-35">But love your enemies, and do  good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-36">Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-37">And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-38">give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-39">And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-40">The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-41">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-42">Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-43">For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-44">For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-45">The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil  out of the evil  bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-46">And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-47">Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-48">he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-6-49">But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
