And the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-11">and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-12">and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-13">and from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretcheth unto Neah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-14">and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtah-el;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-15">and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-16">This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-17">The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-18">And their border was unto Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-19">and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-20">and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-21">and Remeth, and Engannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-22">and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh;

and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-30">Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-31">This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-32">The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-33">And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-34">and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-35">And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-36">and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-37">and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-38">and Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh;

for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-48">This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-49">So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-50">according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-19-51">These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathersâ€™  of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Joshua+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
