raging waves calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the ship that carries him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-2">For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was the artisan who built it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-3">but it is your providence, O Father, that steers its course, because you have given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-4">showing that you can save from every danger, so that even a person who lacks skill may put to sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-5">It is your will that works of your wisdom should not be without effect; therefore people trust their lives even to the smallest piece of wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-6">For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by your hand left to the world the seed of a new generation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-7">For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-8">But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is the one who made itâ€” he for having made it, and the perishable thing because it was named a god.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-9">For equally hateful to God are the ungodly and their ungodliness;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-10">for what was done will be punished together with the one who did it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-11">Therefore there will be a visitation also upon the heathen idols, because, though part of what God created, they became an abomination, snares for human souls and a trap for the feet of the foolish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-12">For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication, and the invention of them was the corruption of life;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-13">for they did not exist from the beginning, nor will they last forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-14">For through human vanity they entered the world, and therefore their speedy end has been planned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-15">For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement, made an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him; he now honored as a god what was once a dead human being, and handed on to his dependents secret rites and initiations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-16">Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law, and at the command of monarchs carved images were worshiped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-17">When people could not honor monarchs in their presence, since they lived at a distance, they imagined their appearance far away, and made a visible image of the king whom they honored, so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-18">Then the ambition of the artisan impelled even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-19">For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler, skillfully forced the likeness to take more beautiful form,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-20">and the multitude, attracted by the charm of his work, now regarded as an object of worship the one whom shortly before they had honored as a human being.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-21">And this became a hidden trap for humankind, because people, in bondage to misfortune or to royal authority, bestowed on objects of stone or wood the name that ought not to be shared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-22">Then it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but though living in great strife due to ignorance, they call such great evils peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-23">For whether they kill children in their initiations, or celebrate secret mysteries, or hold frenzied revels with strange customs,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-24">they no longer keep either their lives or their marriages pure, but they either treacherously kill one another, or grieve one another by adultery,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-25">and all is a raging riot of blood and murder, theft and deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-26">confusion over what is good, forgetfulness of favors, defiling of souls, sexual perversion, disorder in marriages, adultery, and debauchery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-27">For the worship of idols not to be named is the beginning and cause and end of every evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-28">For their worshipers either rave in exultation, or prophesy lies, or live unrighteously, or readily commit perjury;&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-29">for because they trust in lifeless idols they swear wicked oaths and expect to suffer no harm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-30">But just penalties will overtake them on two counts: because they thought wrongly about God in devoting themselves to idols, and because in deceit they swore unrighteously through contempt for holiness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Wis-14-31">For it is not the power of the things by which people swear, but the just penalty for those who sin, that always pursues the transgression of the unrighteous.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Wisdom+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5"
