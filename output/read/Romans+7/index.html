Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-8">but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin  dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-9">And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-10">and the commandment, which  unto life, this I found  unto death:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-11">for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-12">So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-13">Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;â€”that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-15">For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-16">But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-17">So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-18">For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good  not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-19">For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-20">But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-21">I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-23">but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-24">Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-7-25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
