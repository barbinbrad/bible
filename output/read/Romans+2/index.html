Do you not realize that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-5">But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-6">For he will repay according to each one’s deeds:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-7">to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-8">while for those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-9">There will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-10">but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-11">For God shows no partiality.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-12">All who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but the doers of the law who will be justified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-14">When Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, these, though not having the law, are a law to themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-15">They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness; and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-16">on the day when, according to my gospel, God, through Jesus Christ, will judge the secret thoughts of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-17">But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-18">and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-19">and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-21">you, then, that teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-22">You that forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You that abhor idols, do you rob temples?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-23">You that boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-24">For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-25">Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-26">So, if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-27">Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-28">For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-2-29">Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart—it is spiritual and not literal. Such a person receives praise not from others but from God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
