Is it for the oxen that God careth,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-10">or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth,  in hope of partaking.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-11">If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-12">If others partake of  right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-13">Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat  the things of the temple,  they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-14">Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-15">But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for  good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-16">For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-17">For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-18">What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-19">For though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-20">And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-21">to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-23">And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-24">Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-25">And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they  to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-9-27">but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
