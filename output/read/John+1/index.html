Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-22">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-24">And they had been sent from the Pharisees.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-26">John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-27">he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-28">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-29">On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-31">And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-32">And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-34">And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-35">Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-36">and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-38">And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-39">He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-40">One of the two that heard John , and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-41">He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-42">He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-43">On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-49">Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-50">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-1-51">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
