With him were myriads of holy ones; at his right, a host of his own.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-3">Indeed, O favorite among peoples, all his holy ones were in your charge; they marched at your heels, accepted direction from you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-4">Moses charged us with the law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-5">There arose a king in Jeshurun, when the leaders of the people assembled— the united tribes of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-6">May Reuben live, and not die out, even though his numbers are few.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-7">And this he said of Judah: O Lord, give heed to Judah, and bring him to his people; strengthen his hands for him, and be a help against his adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-8">And of Levi he said: Give to Levi your Thummim, and your Urim to your loyal one, whom you tested at Massah, with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-9">who said of his father and mother, “I regard them not”; he ignored his kin, and did not acknowledge his children. For they observed your word, and kept your covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-10">They teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law; they place incense before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-11">Bless, O Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those that hate him, so that they do not rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-12">Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the Lord rests in safety— the High God surrounds him all day long— the beloved rests between his shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-13">And of Joseph he said: Blessed by the Lord be his land, with the choice gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that lies beneath;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-14">with the choice fruits of the sun, and the rich yield of the months;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-15">with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-16">with the choice gifts of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of the one who dwells on Sinai. Let these come on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-17">A firstborn bull—majesty is his! His horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he gores the peoples, driving them to the ends of the earth; such are the myriads of Ephraim, such the thousands of Manasseh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-18">And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-19">They call peoples to the mountain; there they offer the right sacrifices; for they suck the affluence of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-20">And of Gad he said: Blessed be the enlargement of Gad! Gad lives like a lion; he tears at arm and scalp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-21">He chose the best for himself, for there a commander’s allotment was reserved; he came at the head of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his ordinances for Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-22">And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion’s whelp that leaps forth from Bashan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-23">And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, sated with favor, full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the west and the south.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-24">And of Asher he said: Most blessed of sons be Asher; may he be the favorite of his brothers, and may he dip his foot in oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-25">Your bars are iron and bronze; and as your days, so is your strength.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-26">There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your help, majestic through the skies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-27">He subdues the ancient gods, shatters the forces of old; he drove out the enemy before you, and said, “Destroy!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-28">So Israel lives in safety, untroubled is Jacob’s abode in a land of grain and wine, where the heavens drop down dew.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-29">Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you, and you shall tread on their backs.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+32/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+34/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
