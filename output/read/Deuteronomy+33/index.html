With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-8">And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-9">Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-10">They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-11">Bless, Jehovah, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-12">Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; He covereth him all the day long, And he dwelleth between his shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-13">And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-14">And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-15">And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-16">And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. Let  come upon the head of Joseph, And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-17">The firstling of his herd, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them,  the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-18">And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-19">They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-20">And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-21">And he provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved; And he came  the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, And his ordinances with Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-22">And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-23">And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-24">And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-25">Thy bars shall be iron and brass; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-26">There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-27">The eternal God is  dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-28">And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-33-29">Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Deuteronomy+32/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Deuteronomy+34/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
