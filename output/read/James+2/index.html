Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-7">Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-8">Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-9">but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one , he is become guilty of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-12">So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-13">For judgment  without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-14">What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-15">If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-16">and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-17">Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-18">Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from  works, and I by my works will show thee  faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-19">Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-22">Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-23">and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-24">Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-25">And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jas-2-26">For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../James+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../James+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
