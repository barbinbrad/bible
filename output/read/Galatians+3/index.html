He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-17">Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-18">For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-19">What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made;  ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-20">Now a mediator is not  of one; but God is one.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-21">Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-22">But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-23">But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-24">So that the law is become our tutor  unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-25">But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-26">For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-27">For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-28">There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one  in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-3-29">And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Galatians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
