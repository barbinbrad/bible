people was the high priest, Simon son of Onias, who in his life repaired the house, and in his time fortified the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-2">He laid the foundations for the high double walls, the high retaining walls for the temple enclosure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-3">In his days a water cistern was dug, a reservoir like the sea in circumference.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-4">He considered how to save his people from ruin, and fortified the city against siege.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-5">How glorious he was, surrounded by the people, as he came out of the house of the curtain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-6">Like the morning star among the clouds, like the full moon at the festal season;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-7">like the sun shining on the temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming in splendid clouds;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-8">like roses in the days of first fruits, like lilies by a spring of water, like a green shoot on Lebanon on a summer day;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-9">like fire and incense in the censer, like a vessel of hammered gold studded with all kinds of precious stones;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-10">like an olive tree laden with fruit, and like a cypress towering in the clouds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-11">When he put on his glorious robe and clothed himself in perfect splendor, when he went up to the holy altar, he made the court of the sanctuary glorious.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-12">When he received the portions from the hands of the priests, as he stood by the hearth of the altar with a garland of brothers around him, he was like a young cedar on Lebanon surrounded by the trunks of palm trees.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-13">All the sons of Aaron in their splendor held the Lordâ€™s offering in their hands before the whole congregation of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-14">Finishing the service at the altars, and arranging the offering to the Most High, the Almighty,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-15">he held out his hand for the cup and poured a drink offering of the blood of the grape; he poured it out at the foot of the altar, a pleasing odor to the Most High, the king of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-16">Then the sons of Aaron shouted; they blew their trumpets of hammered metal; they sounded a mighty fanfare as a reminder before the Most High.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-17">Then all the people together quickly fell to the ground on their faces to worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-18">Then the singers praised him with their voices in sweet and full-toned melody.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-19">And the people of the Lord Most High offered their prayers before the Merciful One, until the order of worship of the Lord was ended, and they completed his ritual.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-20">Then Simon came down and raised his hands over the whole congregation of Israelites, to pronounce the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to glory in his name;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-21">and they bowed down in worship a second time, to receive the blessing from the Most High.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-22">And now bless the God of all, who everywhere works great wonders, who fosters our growth from birth, and deals with us according to his mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-23">May he give us gladness of heart, and may there be peace in our days in Israel, as in the days of old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-24">May he entrust to us his mercy, and may he deliver us in our days!&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-25">Two nations my soul detests, and the third is not even a people:&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-26">Those who live in Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that live in Shechem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-27">Instruction in understanding and knowledge I have written in this book, Jesus son of Eleazar son of Sirach of Jerusalem, whose mind poured forth wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-28">Happy are those who concern themselves with these things, and those who lay them to heart will become wise.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-50-29">For if they put them into practice, they will be equal to anything, for the fear of the Lord is their path.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev"
