You shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-17">I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down by your enemies; your foes shall rule over you, and you shall flee though no one pursues you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-18">And if in spite of this you will not obey me, I will continue to punish you sevenfold for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-19">I will break your proud glory, and I will make your sky like iron and your earth like copper.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-20">Your strength shall be spent to no purpose: your land shall not yield its produce, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-21">If you continue hostile to me, and will not obey me, I will continue to plague you sevenfold for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-22">I will let loose wild animals against you, and they shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock; they shall make you few in number, and your roads shall be deserted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-23">If in spite of these punishments you have not turned back to me, but continue hostile to me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-24">then I too will continue hostile to you: I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-25">I will bring the sword against you, executing vengeance for the covenant; and if you withdraw within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into enemy hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-26">When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven, and they shall dole out your bread by weight; and though you eat, you shall not be satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-27">But if, despite this, you disobey me, and continue hostile to me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-28">I will continue hostile to you in fury; I in turn will punish you myself sevenfold for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-29">You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-30">I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars; I will heap your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols. I will abhor you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-31">I will lay your cities waste, will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing odors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-32">I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to settle in it shall be appalled at it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-33">And you I will scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword against you; your land shall be a desolation, and your cities a waste.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-34">Then the land shall enjoy its sabbath years as long as it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its sabbath years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-35">As long as it lies desolate, it shall have the rest it did not have on your sabbaths when you were living on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-36">And as for those of you who survive, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall though no one pursues.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-37">They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though no one pursues; and you shall have no power to stand against your enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-38">You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-39">And those of you who survive shall languish in the land of your enemies because of their iniquities; also they shall languish because of the iniquities of their ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-40">But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors, in that they committed treachery against me and, moreover, that they continued hostile to meâ€”&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-41">so that I, in turn, continued hostile to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-42">then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; I will remember also my covenant with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-43">For the land shall be deserted by them, and enjoy its sabbath years by lying desolate without them, while they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they dared to spurn my ordinances, and they abhorred my statutes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-44">Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, or abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-45">but I will remember in their favor the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, to be their God: I am the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-46">These are the statutes and ordinances and laws that the Lord established between himself and the people of Israel on Mount Sinai through Moses.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
