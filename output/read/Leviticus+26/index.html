and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-6">And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-7">And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-8">And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-9">And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-10">And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-11">And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-12">And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-13">I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-14">But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-15">and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-16">I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-17">And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-18">And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-19">And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-20">and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-21">And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-22">And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-23">And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-24">then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-25">And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-26">When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-27">And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-28">then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-29">And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-30">And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-31">And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-32">And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-33">And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-34">Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-35">As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-36">And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-37">And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-38">And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-39">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-40">And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-41">I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-42">then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-43">The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-44">And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-45">but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-26-46">These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
