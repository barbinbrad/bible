I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-30">Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-1-45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
