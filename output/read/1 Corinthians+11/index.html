What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-23">For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-24">and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-25">In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink , in remembrance of me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-28">But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-29">For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-30">For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-31">But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-34">If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
