For her hair is given to her for a covering.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-16">But if anyone is disposed to be contentious—we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-17">Now in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-18">For, to begin with, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and to some extent I believe it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-19">Indeed, there have to be factions among you, for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-20">When you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord’s supper.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-21">For when the time comes to eat, each of you goes ahead with your own supper, and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-22">What! Do you not have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I commend you? In this matter I do not commend you!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-23">For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-24">and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-25">In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-27">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-28">Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-29">For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and drink judgment against themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-30">For this reason many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-31">But if we judged ourselves, we would not be judged.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-32">But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-33">So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-11-34">If you are hungry, eat at home, so that when you come together, it will not be for your condemnation. About the other things I will give instructions when I come.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
