Do so no more, but ask forgiveness for your past sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-2">Flee from sin as from a snake; for if you approach sin, it will bite you. Its teeth are lion’s teeth, and can destroy human lives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-3">All lawlessness is like a two-edged sword; there is no healing for the wound it inflicts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-4">Panic and insolence will waste away riches; thus the house of the proud will be laid waste.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-5">The prayer of the poor goes from their lips to the ears of God, and his judgment comes speedily.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-6">Those who hate reproof walk in the sinner’s steps, but those who fear the Lord repent in their heart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-7">The mighty in speech are widely known; when they slip, the sensible person knows it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-8">Whoever builds his house with other people’s money is like one who gathers stones for his burial mound.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-9">An assembly of the wicked is like a bundle of tow, and their end is a blazing fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-10">The way of sinners is paved with smooth stones, but at its end is the pit of Hades.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-11">Whoever keeps the law controls his thoughts, and the fulfillment of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-12">The one who is not clever cannot be taught, but there is a cleverness that increases bitterness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-13">The knowledge of the wise will increase like a flood, and their counsel like a life-giving spring.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-14">The mind of a fool is like a broken jar; it can hold no knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-15">When an intelligent person hears a wise saying, he praises it and adds to it; when a fool hears it, he laughs at it and throws it behind his back.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-16">A fool’s chatter is like a burden on a journey, but delight is found in the speech of the intelligent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-17">The utterance of a sensible person is sought in the assembly, and they ponder his words in their minds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-18">Like a house in ruins is wisdom to a fool, and to the ignorant, knowledge is talk that has no meaning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-19">To a senseless person education is fetters on his feet, and like manacles on his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-20">A fool raises his voice when he laughs, but the wise smile quietly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-21">To the sensible person education is like a golden ornament, and like a bracelet on the right arm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-22">The foot of a fool rushes into a house, but an experienced person waits respectfully outside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-23">A boor peers into the house from the door, but a cultivated person remains outside.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-24">It is ill-mannered for a person to listen at a door; the discreet would be grieved by the disgrace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-25">The lips of babblers speak of what is not their concern, but the words of the prudent are weighed in the balance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-26">The mind of fools is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-27">When an ungodly person curses an adversary, he curses himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-21-28">A whisperer degrades himself and is hated in his neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
