Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-18">Then the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made five pounds.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-19">He said to him, ‘And you, rule over five cities.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-20">Then the other came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-21">for I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-22">He said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! You knew, did you, that I was a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-23">Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned, I could have collected it with interest.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-24">He said to the bystanders, ‘Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-25">(And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten pounds!’)&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-26">‘I tell you, to all those who have, more will be given; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-27">But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-28">After he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-29">When he had come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-30">saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-31">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say this, ‘The Lord needs it.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-32">So those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-33">As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-34">They said, “The Lord needs it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-35">Then they brought it to Jesus; and after throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-36">As he rode along, people kept spreading their cloaks on the road.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-37">As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-38">saying, “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-39">Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, order your disciples to stop.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-40">He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would shout out.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-41">As he came near and saw the city, he wept over it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-42">saying, “If you, even you, had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-43">Indeed, the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you, and hem you in on every side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-44">They will crush you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave within you one stone upon another; because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-45">Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-46">and he said, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-47">Every day he was teaching in the temple. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-48">but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were spellbound by what they heard.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
