Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-23">then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-24">And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-25">And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-26">I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-27">But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-28">And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-29">And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-30">saying, Go your way into the village over against ; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-31">And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-32">And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-34">And they said, The Lord hath need of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-35">And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-36">And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-37">And as he was now drawing nigh,  at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-38">saying, Blessed  the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-39">And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-40">And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-41">And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-42">saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-43">For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-44">and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-45">And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-46">saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-47">And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-19-48">and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+18/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+20/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
