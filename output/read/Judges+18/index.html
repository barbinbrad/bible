And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself a territory to live in; for until then no territory among the tribes of Israel had been allotted to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-2">So the Danites sent five valiant men from the whole number of their clan, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they stayed there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-3">While they were at Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-4">He said to them, “Micah did such and such for me, and he hired me, and I have become his priest.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-5">Then they said to him, “Inquire of God that we may know whether the mission we are undertaking will succeed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-6">The priest replied, “Go in peace. The mission you are on is under the eye of the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-7">The five men went on, and when they came to Laish, they observed the people who were there living securely, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing on earth, and possessing wealth. Furthermore, they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with Aram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-8">When they came to their kinsfolk at Zorah and Eshtaol, they said to them, “What do you report?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-9">They said, “Come, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, but enter in and possess the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-10">When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad—God has indeed given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything on earth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-11">Six hundred men of the Danite clan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-12">and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-13">From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-14">Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land (that is, Laish) said to their comrades, “Do you know that in these buildings there are an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? Now therefore consider what you will do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-15">So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and greeted him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-16">While the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate,&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-17">the five men who had gone to spy out the land proceeded to enter and take the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim. The priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-18">When the men went into Micah’s house and took the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-19">They said to him, “Keep quiet! Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one person, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-20">Then the priest accepted the offer. He took the ephod, the teraphim, and the idol, and went along with the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-21">So they resumed their journey, putting the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-22">When they were some distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the Danites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-23">They shouted to the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter that you come with such a company?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-24">He replied, “You take my gods that I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then can you ask me, ‘What is the matter?’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-25">And the Danites said to him, “You had better not let your voice be heard among us or else hot-tempered fellows will attack you, and you will lose your life and the lives of your household.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-26">Then the Danites went their way. When Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-27">The Danites, having taken what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, put them to the sword, and burned down the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-28">There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with Aram. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city, and lived in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-29">They named the city Dan, after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was formerly Laish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-30">Then the Danites set up the idol for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the time the land went into captivity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Judg-18-31">So they maintained as their own Micah’s idol that he had made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Judges+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judges+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
