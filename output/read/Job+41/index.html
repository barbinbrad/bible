Or press down his tongue with a cord?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-2">Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-4">Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-6">Will the bands  make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-8">Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-10">None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-11">Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?  under the whole heaven is mine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-12">I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-13">Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-14">Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-15">strong scales are  pride, Shut up together  a close seal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-16">One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-17">They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-18">His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-19">Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-20">Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and  rushes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-21">His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-22">In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-24">His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-26">If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-27">He counteth iron as straw,  brass as rotten wood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-28">The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-29">Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-30">His underparts are  sharp potsherds: He spreadeth  a threshing-wain upon the mire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-32">He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-33">Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-41-34">He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+40/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+42/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
