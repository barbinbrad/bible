His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-3">He committed all the sins that his father did before him; his heart was not true to the Lord his God, like the heart of his father David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-4">Nevertheless for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-5">because David did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-6">The war begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued all the days of his life.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-7">The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-8">Abijam slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. Then his son Asa succeeded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-9">In the twentieth year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-10">he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-11">Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-12">He put away the male temple prostitutes out of the land, and removed all the idols that his ancestors had made.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-13">He also removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for Asherah; Asa cut down her image and burned it at the Wadi Kidron.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-14">But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-15">He brought into the house of the Lord the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts—silver, gold, and utensils.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-16">There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-17">King Baasha of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-18">Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house, and gave them into the hands of his servants. King Asa sent them to King Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon son of Hezion of Aram, who resided in Damascus, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-19">“Let there be an alliance between me and you, like that between my father and your father: I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go, break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-20">Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-21">When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and lived in Tirzah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-22">Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt: they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building; with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-23">Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his power, all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-24">Then Asa slept with his ancestors, and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his father David; his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-25">Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah; he reigned over Israel two years.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-26">He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of his ancestor and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-27">Baasha son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-28">So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa of Judah, and succeeded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-29">As soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam; he left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite—&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-30">because of the sins of Jeroboam that he committed and that he caused Israel to commit, and because of the anger to which he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-31">Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-32">There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-33">In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah; he reigned twenty-four years.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-15-34">He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Kings+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Kings+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
