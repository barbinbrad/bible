But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-28">And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-29">Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-30">why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-31">I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-32">If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-33">Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-34">Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak  to move you to shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-36">Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-37">and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-38">but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one  of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the  of the terrestrial is another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-43">it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-44">it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual .&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-45">So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam  a life-giving spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-46">Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-47">The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-48">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-49">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-51">Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-54">But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-55">O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-56">The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-57">but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-58">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
