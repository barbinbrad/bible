On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them—though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-11">Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-12">Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-13">If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-14">and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-15">We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-16">For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-17">If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-18">Then those also who have died in Christ have perished.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-19">If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-20">But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-21">For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-22">for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-23">But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-24">Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-25">For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-26">The last enemy to be destroyed is death.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-27">For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-28">When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him, so that God may be all in all.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-29">Otherwise, what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-30">And why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-31">I die every day! That is as certain, brothers and sisters, as my boasting of you—a boast that I make in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-32">If with merely human hopes I fought with wild animals at Ephesus, what would I have gained by it? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-33">Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-34">Come to a sober and right mind, and sin no more; for some people have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-35">But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-36">Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-37">And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-38">But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-39">Not all flesh is alike, but there is one flesh for human beings, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-40">There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; indeed, star differs from star in glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-42">So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-43">It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-44">It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-45">Thus it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-46">But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-47">The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-48">As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-49">Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-50">What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-51">Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be changed,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-53">For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-54">When this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-55">“Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-15-58">Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
