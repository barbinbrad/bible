and they built forts against it round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-2">So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-3">On the ninth day of the  month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-4">Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war  by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and  went by the way of the Arabah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-6">Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-7">And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-8">Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-9">And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-10">And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were  the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-11">And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-12">But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-13">And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-14">And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-15">And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-16">The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-17">The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-18">And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-19">and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-20">And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-21">And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-22">And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-23">Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-24">And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-25">But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-26">And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-27">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-28">and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-29">and changed his prison garments. And  did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-30">and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Kings+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Chronicles+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
