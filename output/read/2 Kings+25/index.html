They went in the direction of the Arabah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; all his army was scattered, deserting him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-6">Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-7">They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah; they bound him in fetters and took him to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-8">In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-9">He burned the house of the Lord, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-10">All the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-11">Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon—all the rest of the population.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-12">But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and tillers of the soil.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-13">The bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord, as well as the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-14">They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the dishes for incense, and all the bronze vessels used in the temple service,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-15">as well as the firepans and the basins. What was made of gold the captain of the guard took away for the gold, and what was made of silver, for the silver.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-16">As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weighing.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-17">The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and on it was a bronze capital; the height of the capital was three cubits; latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, were on the capital all around. The second pillar had the same, with the latticework.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-18">The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah, the second priest Zephaniah, and the three guardians of the threshold;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-19">from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the soldiers, and five men of the king’s council who were found in the city; the secretary who was the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-20">Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-21">The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile out of its land.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-22">He appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had left.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-23">Now when all the captains of the forces and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-24">Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid because of the Chaldean officials; live in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-25">But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men; they struck down Gedaliah so that he died, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-26">Then all the people, high and low, and the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-27">In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-28">he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the other seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-29">So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes. Every day of his life he dined regularly in the king’s presence.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Kgs-25-30">For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, a portion every day, as long as he lived.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Kings+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Chronicles+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
