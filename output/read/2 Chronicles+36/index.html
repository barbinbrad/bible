He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-6">Against him King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up, and bound him with fetters to take him to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-7">Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-8">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations that he did, and what was found against him, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-9">Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-10">In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, along with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made his brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-11">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-12">He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah who spoke from the mouth of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-13">He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord, the God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-14">All the leading priests and the people also were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of the Lord that he had consecrated in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-15">The Lord, the God of their ancestors, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-16">but they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord against his people became so great that there was no remedy.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-17">Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their youths with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or young woman, the aged or the feeble; he gave them all into his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-18">All the vessels of the house of God, large and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king and of his officials, all these he brought to Babylon.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-19">They burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-20">He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-21">to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had made up for its sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-22">In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom and also declared in a written edict:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Chr-36-23">“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him!
