I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-3">Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us; let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the Lord our God, or he will fall upon us with pestilence or sword.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-4">But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Get to your labors!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-5">Pharaoh continued, “Now they are more numerous than the people of the land and yet you want them to stop working!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-6">That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, as well as their supervisors,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-7">“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-8">But you shall require of them the same quantity of bricks as they have made previously; do not diminish it, for they are lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-9">Let heavier work be laid on them; then they will labor at it and pay no attention to deceptive words.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-10">So the taskmasters and the supervisors of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-11">Go and get straw yourselves, wherever you can find it; but your work will not be lessened in the least.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-12">So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-13">The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, the same daily assignment as when you were given straw.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-14">And the supervisors of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why did you not finish the required quantity of bricks yesterday and today, as you did before?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-15">Then the Israelite supervisors came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you treat your servants like this?&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-16">No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Look how your servants are beaten! You are unjust to your own people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-17">He said, “You are lazy, lazy; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-18">Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, but you shall still deliver the same number of bricks.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-19">The Israelite supervisors saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You shall not lessen your daily number of bricks.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-20">As they left Pharaoh, they came upon Moses and Aaron who were waiting to meet them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-21">They said to them, “The Lord look upon you and judge! You have brought us into bad odor with Pharaoh and his officials, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-22">Then Moses turned again to the Lord and said, “O Lord, why have you mistreated this people? Why did you ever send me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-5-23">Since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has mistreated this people, and you have done nothing at all to deliver your people.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
