It was about noon.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-7">A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-8">(His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-9">The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-10">Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-11">The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-12">Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-13">Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-14">but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-15">The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-16">Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-17">The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-18">for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-19">The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-20">Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-21">Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-22">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-23">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-24">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-25">The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-26">Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-27">Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-28">Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-29">“Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-30">They left the city and were on their way to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-31">Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-32">But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-33">So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-34">Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-35">Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-36">The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-37">For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-38">I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-39">Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-41">And many more believed because of his word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-42">They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-43">When the two days were over, he went from that place to Galilee&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-44">(for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophet’s own country).&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-45">When he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival; for they too had gone to the festival.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-46">Then he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-48">Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-49">The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my little boy dies.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-50">Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-51">As he was going down, his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-52">So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they said to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-53">The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole household.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-54">Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
