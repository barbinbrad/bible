Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am .&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-29">Come, see a man, who told me all things that  I did: can this be the Christ?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him  to eat?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and  cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that  I did.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-41">And many more believed because of his word;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought  that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-53">So the father knew that  at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-4-54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
