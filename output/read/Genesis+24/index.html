he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-8">And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-9">And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-10">And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-11">And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-12">And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-13">Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-14">and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-15">And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-16">And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-17">And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-18">And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-19">And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-20">And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-21">And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-22">And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-23">and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-24">And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-25">She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-26">And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-27">And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-28">And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-29">And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-30">And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-31">And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-32">And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-33">And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-34">And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-35">And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-36">And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-37">And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-38">but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-39">And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-40">And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-41">then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-42">And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-43">behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-44">and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master’s son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-45">And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-46">And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-47">And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-48">And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-49">And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-50">Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-51">Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-52">And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-53">And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-54">And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-55">And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us  days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-56">And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-57">And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-58">And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-59">And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-60">And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou  of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-61">And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-62">And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-63">And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-64">And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-65">And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-66">And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gen-24-67">And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Genesis+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Genesis+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
