When they were standing before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-4">the herald proclaimed aloud, “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-5">that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-6">Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-7">Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-8">Accordingly, at this time certain Chaldeans came forward and denounced the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-9">They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-10">You, O king, have made a decree, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, shall fall down and worship the golden statue,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-11">and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-12">There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These pay no heed to you, O king. They do not serve your gods and they do not worship the golden statue that you have set up.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought in; so they brought those men before the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-14">Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods and you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up?&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-15">Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble to fall down and worship the statue that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire, and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-17">If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and out of your hand, O king, let him deliver us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-18">But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-20">and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-21">So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-22">Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-23">But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-24">They walked around in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-25">Then Azariah stood still in the fire and prayed aloud:&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-26">“Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise; and glorious is your name forever!&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-27">For you are just in all you have done; all your works are true and your ways right, and all your judgments are true.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-28">You have executed true judgments in all you have brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our ancestors; by a true judgment you have brought all this upon us because of our sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-29">For we have sinned and broken your law in turning away from you; in all matters we have sinned grievously.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-30">We have not obeyed your commandments, we have not kept them or done what you have commanded us for our own good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-31">So all that you have brought upon us, and all that you have done to us, you have done by a true judgment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-32">You have handed us over to our enemies, lawless and hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-33">And now we cannot open our mouths; we, your servants who worship you, have become a shame and a reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-34">For your name’s sake do not give us up forever, and do not annul your covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-35">Do not withdraw your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham your beloved and for the sake of your servant Isaac and Israel your holy one,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-36">to whom you promised to multiply their descendants like the stars of heaven and like the sand on the shore of the sea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-37">For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any other nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-38">In our day we have no ruler, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before you and to find mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-39">Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-40">as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, or with tens of thousands of fat lambs; such may our sacrifice be in your sight today, and may we unreservedly follow you, for no shame will come to those who trust in you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-41">And now with all our heart we follow you; we fear you and seek your presence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-42">Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in your patience and in your abundant mercy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-43">Deliver us in accordance with your marvelous works, and bring glory to your name, O Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-44">Let all who do harm to your servants be put to shame; let them be disgraced and deprived of all power, and let their strength be broken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-45">Let them know that you alone are the Lord God, glorious over the whole world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-46">Now the king’s servants who threw them in kept stoking the furnace with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brushwood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-47">And the flames poured out above the furnace forty-nine cubits,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-48">and spread out and burned those Chaldeans who were caught near the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-49">But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace,&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-50">and made the inside of the furnace as though a moist wind were whistling through it. The fire did not touch them at all and caused them no pain or distress.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-51">Then the three with one voice praised and glorified and blessed God in the furnace:&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-52">“Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and to be praised and highly exalted forever; And blessed is your glorious, holy name, and to be highly praised and highly exalted forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-53">Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory, and to be extolled and highly glorified forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-54">Blessed are you who look into the depths from your throne on the cherubim, and to be praised and highly exalted forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-55">Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom, and to be extolled and highly exalted forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-56">Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven, and to be sung and glorified forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-57">“Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-58">Bless the Lord, you heavens; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-59">Bless the Lord, you angels of the Lord; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-60">Bless the Lord, all you waters above the heavens; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-61">Bless the Lord, all you powers of the Lord; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-62">Bless the Lord, sun and moon; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-63">Bless the Lord, stars of heaven; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-64">“Bless the Lord, all rain and dew; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-65">Bless the Lord, all you winds; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-66">Bless the Lord, fire and heat; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-67">Bless the Lord, winter cold and summer heat; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-68">Bless the Lord, dews and falling snow; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-69">Bless the Lord, ice and cold; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-70">Bless the Lord, frosts and snows; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-71">Bless the Lord, nights and days; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-72">Bless the Lord, light and darkness; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-73">Bless the Lord, lightnings and clouds; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-74">“Let the earth bless the Lord; let it sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-75">Bless the Lord, mountains and hills; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-76">Bless the Lord, all that grows in the ground; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-77">Bless the Lord, you springs; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-78">Bless the Lord, seas and rivers; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-79">Bless the Lord, you whales and all that swim in the waters; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-80">Bless the Lord, all birds of the air; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-81">Bless the Lord, all wild animals and cattle; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-82">“Bless the Lord, all people on earth; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-83">Bless the Lord, O Israel; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-84">Bless the Lord, you priests of the Lord; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-85">Bless the Lord, you servants of the Lord; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-86">Bless the Lord, spirits and souls of the righteous; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-87">Bless the Lord, you who are holy and humble in heart; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-88">“Bless the Lord, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael; sing praise to him and highly exalt him forever. For he has rescued us from Hades and saved us from the power of death, and delivered us from the midst of the burning fiery furnace; from the midst of the fire he has delivered us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-89">Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-90">All who worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, sing praise to him and give thanks to him, for his mercy endures forever.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-91">Hearing them sing, and amazed at seeing them alive, King Nebuchadnezzar rose up quickly. He said to his counselors, “Was it not three men that we threw bound into the fire?” They answered the king, “True, O king.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-92">He replied, “But I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the fourth has the appearance of a god.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-93">Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-94">And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their tunics were not harmed, and not even the smell of fire came from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-95">Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king’s command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-96">Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Dan-3-97">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Daniel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Daniel+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
