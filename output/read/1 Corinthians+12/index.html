If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-18">But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-20">But now they are many members, but one body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-22">Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-23">and those  of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely  have more abundant comeliness;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-24">whereas our comely  have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that  which lacked;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-25">that there should be no schism in the body; but  the members should have the same care one for another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-26">And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or  member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments,  kinds of tongues.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all miracles?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-31">But desire earnestly the greater gifts.
