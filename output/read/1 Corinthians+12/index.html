If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-18">But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-19">If all were a single member, where would the body be?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-20">As it is, there are many members, yet one body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-21">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-22">On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-23">and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-24">whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-25">that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-26">If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-27">Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-28">And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-30">Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-12-31">But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
