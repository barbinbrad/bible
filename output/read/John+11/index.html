Those who walk during the day do not stumble, because they see the light of this world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-10">But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-11">After saying this, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to awaken him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-12">The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be all right.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-13">Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-14">Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-15">For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-16">Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-17">When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-20">When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-21">Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-22">But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-23">Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-24">Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-25">Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-26">and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-27">She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-28">When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-29">And when she heard it, she got up quickly and went to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-30">Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-31">The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-32">When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-34">He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-35">Jesus began to weep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-36">So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-37">But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-38">Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-39">Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-40">Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-41">So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you for having heard me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-42">I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-43">When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-44">The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-45">Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-47">So the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the council, and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-48">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-49">But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-50">You do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-51">He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-52">and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the dispersed children of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-53">So from that day on they planned to put him to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-54">Jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the Jews, but went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness; and he remained there with the disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-55">Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-56">They were looking for Jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he will not come to the festival, will he?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should let them know, so that they might arrest him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
