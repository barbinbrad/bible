If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-10">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-11">These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-12">The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-14">Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-16">Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-17">So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-18">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-20">Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-21">Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-22">And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-23">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-24">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-25">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-26">and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-27">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God,  he that cometh into the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-28">And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-29">And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-30">(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-31">The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-32">Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-34">and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-35">Jesus wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-36">The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-37">But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-39">Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been  four days.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-40">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-41">So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-42">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-43">And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-44">He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-45">Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-47">The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-48">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-49">But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-50">nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-51">Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-52">and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-53">So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-55">Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-56">They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-11-57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
