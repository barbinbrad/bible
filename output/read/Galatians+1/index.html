Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-7">not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that one be accursed!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-9">As we have said before, so now I repeat, if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that one be accursed!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-10">Am I now seeking human approval, or God’s approval? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still pleasing people, I would not be a servant of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-11">For I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-12">for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-13">You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-14">I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-15">But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-16">to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-18">Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-19">but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-20">In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-21">Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-22">and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-23">they only heard it said, “The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-24">And they glorified God because of me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
