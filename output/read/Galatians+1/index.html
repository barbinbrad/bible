Amen.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-6">I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-7">which is not another : only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-9">As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-11">For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but  through revelation of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-14">and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me,  from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-17">neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-20">Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-21">Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-22">And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-23">but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;&nbsp;</span><span id="Gal-1-24">and they glorified God in me.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Corinthians+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Galatians+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
