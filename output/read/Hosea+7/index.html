Now their deeds surround them, they are before my face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-3">By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the officials by their treachery.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-4">They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven, whose baker does not need to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-5">On the day of our king the officials became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-6">For they are kindled like an oven, their heart burns within them; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-7">All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-8">Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-9">Foreigners devour his strength, but he does not know it; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, but he does not know it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-10">Israelâ€™s pride testifies against him; yet they do not return to the Lord their God, or seek him, for all this.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-11">Ephraim has become like a dove, silly and without sense; they call upon Egypt, they go to Assyria.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-12">As they go, I will cast my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will discipline them according to the report made to their assembly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-13">Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-14">They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; they gash themselves for grain and wine; they rebel against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-15">It was I who trained and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Hos-7-16">They turn to that which does not profit; they have become like a defective bow; their officials shall fall by the sword because of the rage of their tongue. So much for their babbling in the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Hosea+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Hosea+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
