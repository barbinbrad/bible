and they informed the governor against Paul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-4">But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-6">who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-7">from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-8">And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-9">And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence: &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-10">seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-11">and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-12">Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-13">But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-14">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-15">Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-16">Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-17">amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but  certain Jews from Asiaâ€”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-18">who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-19">Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-20">except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-21">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-22">And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-23">But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-24">And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-25">He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-24-26">But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
