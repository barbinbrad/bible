the people of the land shall stone them to death. &nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-3">I myself will set my face against them, and will cut them off from the people, because they have given of their offspring to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-4">And if the people of the land should ever close their eyes to them, when they give of their offspring to Molech, and do not put them to death,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-5">I myself will set my face against them and against their family, and will cut them off from among their people, them and all who follow them in prostituting themselves to Molech.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-6">If any turn to mediums and wizards, prostituting themselves to them, I will set my face against them, and will cut them off from the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-7">Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-8">Keep my statutes, and observe them; I am the Lord; I sanctify you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-9">All who curse father or mother shall be put to death; having cursed father or mother, their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-10">If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-11">The man who lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall be put to death; their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-12">If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed perversion, their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-13">If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-14">If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is depravity; they shall be burned to death, both he and they, that there may be no depravity among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-15">If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the animal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-16">If a woman approaches any animal and has sexual relations with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-17">If a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace, and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness, he shall be subject to punishment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-18">If a man lies with a woman having her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow and she has laid bare her flow of blood; both of them shall be cut off from their people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-19">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for that is to lay bare one’s own flesh; they shall be subject to punishment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-20">If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they shall be subject to punishment; they shall die childless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-21">If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-22">You shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and observe them, so that the land to which I bring you to settle in may not vomit you out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-23">You shall not follow the practices of the nation that I am driving out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-24">But I have said to you: You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God; I have separated you from the peoples.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-25">You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; you shall not bring abomination on yourselves by animal or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-26">You shall be holy to me; for I the Lord am holy, and I have separated you from the other peoples to be mine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-20-27">A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned to death, their blood is upon them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+19/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+21/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
