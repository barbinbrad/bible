Although this is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-10">He said: I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform marvels, such as have not been performed in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you live shall see the work of the Lord; for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-11">Observe what I command you today. See, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-12">Take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it will become a snare among you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-13">You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their sacred poles&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-14">(for you shall worship no other god, because the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-15">You shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone among them will invite you, and you will eat of the sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-16">And you will take wives from among their daughters for your sons, and their daughters who prostitute themselves to their gods will make your sons also prostitute themselves to their gods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-17">You shall not make cast idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-18">You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-19">All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-20">The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty-handed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-21">Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-22">You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-23">Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-24">For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-25">You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-26">The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-27">The Lord said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-28">He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-29">Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-30">When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-31">But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-32">Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-33">When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-34">but whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-34-35">the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+35/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
