They were asking for Simon’s house and were standing by the gate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-18">They called out to ask whether Simon, who was called Peter, was staying there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-19">While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look, three men are searching for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-20">Now get up, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-21">So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-22">They answered, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-23">So Peter invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the believers from Joppa accompanied him. &nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-24">The following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-25">On Peter’s arrival Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, worshiped him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-26">But Peter made him get up, saying, “Stand up; I am only a mortal.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-27">And as he talked with him, he went in and found that many had assembled;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-28">and he said to them, “You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-29">So when I was sent for, I came without objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-30">Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, at three o’clock, I was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-31">He said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-32">Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-33">Therefore I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. So now all of us are here in the presence of God to listen to all that the Lord has commanded you to say.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-34">Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-35">but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-36">You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-37">That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-38">how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-39">We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-40">but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-41">not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-42">He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-43">All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-44">While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-45">The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-46">for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-47">“Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-10-48">So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+11/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
