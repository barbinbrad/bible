People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-3">When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-4">Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, “Look at us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-5">And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-6">But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-7">And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-8">Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-9">All the people saw him walking and praising God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-10">and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-11">While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s Portico, utterly astonished.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-12">When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, “You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-13">The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-14">But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-15">and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-16">And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-17">“And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-18">In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-19">Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-20">so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-21">who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-22">Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-23">And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-24">And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-25">You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-3-26">When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
