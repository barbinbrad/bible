In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-5">On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-6">So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-7">and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your complaining against the Lord. For what are we, that you complain against us?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-8">And Moses said, “When the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the Lord has heard the complaining that you utter against him—what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-9">Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, ‘Draw near to the Lord, for he has heard your complaining.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-10">And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-11">The Lord spoke to Moses and said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-12">“I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-13">In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-14">When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-15">When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-16">This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Gather as much of it as each of you needs, an omer to a person according to the number of persons, all providing for those in their own tents.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-17">The Israelites did so, some gathering more, some less.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-18">But when they measured it with an omer, those who gathered much had nothing over, and those who gathered little had no shortage; they gathered as much as each of them needed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-19">And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over until morning.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-20">But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses was angry with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-21">Morning by morning they gathered it, as much as each needed; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-22">On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers apiece. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-23">he said to them, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-24">So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-25">Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-26">Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-27">On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-28">The Lord said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and instructions?&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-29">See! The Lord has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your place on the seventh day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-30">So the people rested on the seventh day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-31">The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-32">Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-33">And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord, to be kept throughout your generations.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-34">As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for safekeeping.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-35">The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-16-36">An omer is a tenth of an ephah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Exodus+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
