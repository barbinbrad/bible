Then the fire of the Lord burned against them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-2">But the people cried out to Moses; and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire abated.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-3">So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the Lord burned against them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-4">The rabble among them had a strong craving; and the Israelites also wept again, and said, “If only we had meat to eat!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-5">We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-6">but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-7">Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color was like the color of gum resin.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-8">The people went around and gathered it, ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, then boiled it in pots and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-9">When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna would fall with it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-10">Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, all at the entrances of their tents. Then the Lord became very angry, and Moses was displeased.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-11">So Moses said to the Lord, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-12">Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a sucking child, to the land that you promised on oath to their ancestors’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-13">Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they come weeping to me and say, ‘Give us meat to eat!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-14">I am not able to carry all this people alone, for they are too heavy for me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-15">If this is the way you are going to treat me, put me to death at once—if I have found favor in your sight—and do not let me see my misery.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-16">So the Lord said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them take their place there with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-17">I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people along with you so that you will not bear it all by yourself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-18">And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wailed in the hearing of the Lord, saying, ‘If only we had meat to eat! Surely it was better for us in Egypt.’ Therefore the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-19">You shall eat not only one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-20">but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you—because you have rejected the Lord who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-21">But Moses said, “The people I am with number six hundred thousand on foot; and you say, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month’!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-22">Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them? Are there enough fish in the sea to catch for them?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-23">The Lord said to Moses, “Is the Lord’s power limited? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-24">So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord; and he gathered seventy elders of the people, and placed them all around the tent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-25">Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do so again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-26">Two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-27">And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-28">And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, “My lord Moses, stop them!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-29">But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit on them!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-30">And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-31">Then a wind went out from the Lord, and it brought quails from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits deep on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-32">So the people worked all that day and night and all the next day, gathering the quails; the least anyone gathered was ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-33">But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord struck the people with a very great plague.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-34">So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-11-35">From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
