And she constrained us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-16">And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-17">The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-18">And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-20">and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-21">and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-24">who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-26">and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every oneâ€™s bands were loosed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-27">And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-29">And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-30">and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-32">And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-34">And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-36">And the jailor reported the words to Paul, , The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-38">And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-39">and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-16-40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into  Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
