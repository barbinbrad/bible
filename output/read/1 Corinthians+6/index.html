And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-3">Do you not know that we are to judge angels—to say nothing of ordinary matters?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-4">If you have ordinary cases, then, do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-5">I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-6">but a believer goes to court against a believer—and before unbelievers at that?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-7">In fact, to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-8">But you yourselves wrong and defraud—and believers at that.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-9">Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-10">thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-11">And this is what some of you used to be. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-12">“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-13">“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food,” and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is meant not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-14">And God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-15">Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-16">Do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, “The two shall be one flesh.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-17">But anyone united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-18">Shun fornication! Every sin that a person commits is outside the body; but the fornicator sins against the body itself.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-19">Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Cor-6-20">For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Corinthians+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Corinthians+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
