All the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. So why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-4">When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-5">Then he said to Korah and all his company, “In the morning the Lord will make known who is his, and who is holy, and who will be allowed to approach him; the one whom he will choose he will allow to approach him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-6">Do this: take censers, Korah and all your company,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-7">and tomorrow put fire in them, and lay incense on them before the Lord; and the man whom the Lord chooses shall be the holy one. You Levites have gone too far!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-8">Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you Levites!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-9">Is it too little for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to allow you to approach him in order to perform the duties of the Lord’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation and serve them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-10">He has allowed you to approach him, and all your brother Levites with you; yet you seek the priesthood as well!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-11">Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the Lord. What is Aaron that you rail against him?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-12">Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab; but they said, “We will not come!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-13">Is it too little that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also lord it over us?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-14">It is clear you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-15">Moses was very angry and said to the Lord, “Pay no attention to their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed any one of them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-16">And Moses said to Korah, “As for you and all your company, be present tomorrow before the Lord, you and they and Aaron;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-17">and let each one of you take his censer, and put incense on it, and each one of you present his censer before the Lord, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-18">So each man took his censer, and they put fire in the censers and laid incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-19">Then Korah assembled the whole congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole congregation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-20">Then the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-21">Separate yourselves from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-22">They fell on their faces, and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one person sin and you become angry with the whole congregation?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-23">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-24">Say to the congregation: Get away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-25">So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-26">He said to the congregation, “Turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, or you will be swept away for all their sins.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-27">So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, their children, and their little ones.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-28">And Moses said, “This is how you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works; it has not been of my own accord:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-29">If these people die a natural death, or if a natural fate comes on them, then the Lord has not sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-30">But if the Lord creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-31">As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground under them was split apart.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-32">The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households—everyone who belonged to Korah and all their goods.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-33">So they with all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol; the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-34">All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “The earth will swallow us too!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-35">And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred fifty men offering the incense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-36">Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-37">Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to take the censers out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-38">For the censers of these sinners have become holy at the cost of their lives. Make them into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they presented them before the Lord and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-39">So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been presented by those who were burned; and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar—&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-40">a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, shall approach to offer incense before the Lord, so as not to become like Korah and his company—just as the Lord had said to him through Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-41">On the next day, however, the whole congregation of the Israelites rebelled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the Lord.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-42">And when the congregation had assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting; the cloud had covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-43">Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-44">and the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-45">“Get away from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-46">Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire on it from the altar and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the Lord; the plague has begun.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-47">So Aaron took it as Moses had ordered, and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-48">He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-49">Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-16-50">When the plague was stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+17/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
