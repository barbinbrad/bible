Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-11">And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-12">He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-14">but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-16">Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-17">And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Chr-17-18">What can David  yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant?
