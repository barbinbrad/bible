All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-3">The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-4">they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-5">Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-6">They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-7">When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-8">And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-9">When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-10">Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-11">She said, “No one, sir.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.”]]&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-12">Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-13">Then the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-14">Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-15">You judge by human standards; I judge no one.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-16">Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-17">In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-18">I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-19">Then they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-20">He spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple, but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-21">Again he said to them, “I am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-22">Then the Jews said, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-23">He said to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-24">I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-25">They said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Why do I speak to you at all?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-26">I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-27">They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-28">So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father instructed me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-29">And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-30">As he was saying these things, many believed in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-31">Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-32">and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-33">They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean by saying, ‘You will be made free’?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-34">Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-35">The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-36">So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-37">I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me, because there is no place in you for my word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-38">I declare what I have seen in the Father’s presence; as for you, you should do what you have heard from the Father.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-39">They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would be doing what Abraham did,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-40">but now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-41">You are indeed doing what your father does.” They said to him, “We are not illegitimate children; we have one father, God himself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-42">Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own, but he sent me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-43">Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-44">You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-45">But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-46">Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-47">Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-48">The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-49">Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-50">Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-51">Very truly, I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-52">The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets; yet you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-53">Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-54">Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, he of whom you say, ‘He is our God,’&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-55">though you do not know him. But I know him; if I would say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-56">Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-57">Then the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-58">Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-8-59">So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
