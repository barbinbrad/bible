and you shall bring in the lampstand, and set up its lamps.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-5">You shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the covenant, and set up the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-6">You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-7">and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-8">You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-9">Then you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it shall become holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-10">You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, so that the altar shall be most holy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-11">You shall also anoint the basin with its stand, and consecrate it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-12">Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-13">and put on Aaron the sacred vestments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, so that he may serve me as priest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-14">You shall bring his sons also and put tunics on them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-15">and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests: and their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout all generations to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-16">Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-17">In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-18">Moses set up the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-19">and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-20">He took the covenant and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above the ark;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-21">and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the curtain for screening, and screened the ark of the covenant; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-22">He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-23">and set the bread in order on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-24">He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-25">and set up the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-26">He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-27">and offered fragrant incense on it; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-28">He also put in place the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-29">He set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-30">He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing,&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-31">with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-32">When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed; as the Lord had commanded Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-33">He set up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the screen at the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-34">Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-35">Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-36">Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on each stage of their journey;&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-37">but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Exod-40-38">For the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel at each stage of their journey.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Exodus+39/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
