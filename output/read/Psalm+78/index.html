Will he provide flesh for his people?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-21">Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-22">Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-23">Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-24">And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-25">Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-26">He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-27">He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-28">And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-29">So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-30">They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-31">When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-32">For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-33">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-34">When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-35">And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-36">But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-37">For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-38">But he, being merciful, forgave  iniquity, and destroyed  not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-39">And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-40">How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-41">And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-42">They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-43">How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-44">And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-46">He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-47">He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-48">He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-49">He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-50">He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-51">And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-52">But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-53">And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-54">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-55">He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-56">Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-57">But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-59">When God heard , he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-60">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-61">And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversaryâ€™s hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-62">He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-63">Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-64">Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-65">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-66">And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-67">Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-68">But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-69">And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-70">He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-71">From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-72">So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+77/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+79/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
