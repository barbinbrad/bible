incline your ears to the words of my mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-2">I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-3">things that we have heard and known, that our ancestors have told us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-4">We will not hide them from their children; we will tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-5">He established a decree in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-6">that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and rise up and tell them to their children,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-7">so that they should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-8">and that they should not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-9">The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-10">They did not keep God’s covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-11">They forgot what he had done, and the miracles that he had shown them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-12">In the sight of their ancestors he worked marvels in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-13">He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-14">In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all night long with a fiery light.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-15">He split rocks open in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-16">He made streams come out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down like rivers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-17">Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-18">They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-19">They spoke against God, saying, “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-20">Even though he struck the rock so that water gushed out and torrents overflowed, can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-21">Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of rage; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-22">because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-23">Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-24">he rained down on them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-25">Mortals ate of the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-26">He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-27">he rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-28">he let them fall within their camp, all around their dwellings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-29">And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-30">But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-31">the anger of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them, and laid low the flower of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-32">In spite of all this they still sinned; they did not believe in his wonders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-33">So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-34">When he killed them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-35">They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-36">But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-37">Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-38">Yet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; often he restrained his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-39">He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not come again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-40">How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-41">They tested God again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-42">They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-43">when he displayed his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zoan.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-44">He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-46">He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-47">He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-48">He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-49">He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-50">He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-51">He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-52">Then he led out his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-53">He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-54">And he brought them to his holy hill, to the mountain that his right hand had won.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-55">He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-56">Yet they tested the Most High God, and rebelled against him. They did not observe his decrees,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-57">but turned away and were faithless like their ancestors; they twisted like a treacherous bow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-59">When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-60">He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mortals,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-61">and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-62">He gave his people to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-63">Fire devoured their young men, and their girls had no marriage song.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-64">Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-65">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior shouting because of wine.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-66">He put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting disgrace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-67">He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-68">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-69">He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-70">He chose his servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-71">from tending the nursing ewes he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel, his inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-78-72">With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skillful hand.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+77/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+79/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
