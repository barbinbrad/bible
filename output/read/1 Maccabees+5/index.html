So they began to kill and destroy among the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-3">But Judas made war on the descendants of Esau in Idumea, at Akrabattene, because they kept lying in wait for Israel. He dealt them a heavy blow and humbled them and despoiled them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-4">He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a trap and a snare to the people and ambushed them on the highways.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-5">They were shut up by him in their towers; and he encamped against them, vowed their complete destruction, and burned with fire their towers and all who were in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-6">Then he crossed over to attack the Ammonites, where he found a strong band and many people, with Timothy as their leader.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-7">He engaged in many battles with them, and they were crushed before him; he struck them down.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-8">He also took Jazer and its villages; then he returned to Judea.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-9">Now the Gentiles in Gilead gathered together against the Israelites who lived in their territory, and planned to destroy them. But they fled to the stronghold of Dathema,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-10">and sent to Judas and his brothers a letter that said, “The Gentiles around us have gathered together to destroy us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-11">They are preparing to come and capture the stronghold to which we have fled, and Timothy is leading their forces.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-12">Now then, come and rescue us from their hands, for many of us have fallen,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-13">and all our kindred who were in the land of Tob have been killed; the enemy have captured their wives and children and goods, and have destroyed about a thousand persons there.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-14">While the letter was still being read, other messengers, with their garments torn, came from Galilee and made a similar report;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-15">they said that the people of Ptolemais and Tyre and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, had gathered together against them “to annihilate us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-16">When Judas and the people heard these messages, a great assembly was called to determine what they should do for their kindred who were in distress and were being attacked by enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-17">Then Judas said to his brother Simon, “Choose your men and go and rescue your kindred in Galilee; Jonathan my brother and I will go to Gilead.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-18">But he left Joseph, son of Zechariah, and Azariah, a leader of the people, with the rest of the forces, in Judea to guard it;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-19">and he gave them this command, “Take charge of this people, but do not engage in battle with the Gentiles until we return.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-20">Then three thousand men were assigned to Simon to go to Galilee, and eight thousand to Judas for Gilead.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-21">So Simon went to Galilee and fought many battles against the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were crushed before him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-22">He pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais; as many as three thousand of the Gentiles fell, and he despoiled them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-23">Then he took the Jews of Galilee and Arbatta, with their wives and children, and all they possessed, and led them to Judea with great rejoicing.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-24">Judas Maccabeus and his brother Jonathan crossed the Jordan and made three days’ journey into the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-25">They encountered the Nabateans, who met them peaceably and told them all that had happened to their kindred in Gilead:&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-26">“Many of them have been shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, in Alema and Chaspho, Maked and Carnaim”—all these towns were strong and large—&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-27">“and some have been shut up in the other towns of Gilead; the enemy are getting ready to attack the strongholds tomorrow and capture and destroy all these people in a single day.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-28">Then Judas and his army quickly turned back by the wilderness road to Bozrah; and he took the town, and killed every male by the edge of the sword; then he seized all its spoils and burned it with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-29">He left the place at night, and they went all the way to the stronghold of Dathema.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-30">At dawn they looked out and saw a large company, which could not be counted, carrying ladders and engines of war to capture the stronghold, and attacking the Jews within.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-31">So Judas saw that the battle had begun and that the cry of the town went up to Heaven, with trumpets and loud shouts,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-32">and he said to the men of his forces, “Fight today for your kindred!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-33">Then he came up behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets and cried aloud in prayer.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-34">And when the army of Timothy realized that it was Maccabeus, they fled before him, and he dealt them a heavy blow. As many as eight thousand of them fell that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-35">Next he turned aside to Maapha, and fought against it and took it; and he killed every male in it, plundered it, and burned it with fire.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-36">From there he marched on and took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other towns of Gilead.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-37">After these things Timothy gathered another army and encamped opposite Raphon, on the other side of the stream.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-38">Judas sent men to spy out the camp, and they reported to him, “All the Gentiles around us have gathered to him; it is a very large force.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-39">They also have hired Arabs to help them, and they are encamped across the stream, ready to come and fight against you.” And Judas went to meet them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-40">Now as Judas and his army drew near to the stream of water, Timothy said to the officers of his forces, “If he crosses over to us first, we will not be able to resist him, for he will surely defeat us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-41">But if he shows fear and camps on the other side of the river, we will cross over to him and defeat him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-42">When Judas approached the stream of water, he stationed the officers of the army at the stream and gave them this command, “Permit no one to encamp, but make them all enter the battle.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-43">Then he crossed over against them first, and the whole army followed him. All the Gentiles were defeated before him, and they threw away their arms and fled into the sacred precincts at Carnaim.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-44">But he took the town and burned the sacred precincts with fire, together with all who were in them. Thus Carnaim was conquered; they could stand before Judas no longer.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-45">Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites in Gilead, the small and the great, with their wives and children and goods, a very large company, to go to the land of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-46">So they came to Ephron. This was a large and very strong town on the road, and they could not go around it to the right or to the left; they had to go through it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-47">But the people of the town shut them out and blocked up the gates with stones.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-48">Judas sent them this friendly message, “Let us pass through your land to get to our land. No one will do you harm; we will simply pass by on foot.” But they refused to open to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-49">Then Judas ordered proclamation to be made to the army that all should encamp where they were.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-50">So the men of the forces encamped, and he fought against the town all that day and all the night, and the town was delivered into his hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-51">He destroyed every male by the edge of the sword, and razed and plundered the town. Then he passed through the town over the bodies of the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-52">Then they crossed the Jordan into the large plain before Beth-shan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-53">Judas kept rallying the laggards and encouraging the people all the way until he came to the land of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-54">So they went up to Mount Zion with joy and gladness, and offered burnt offerings, because they had returned in safety; not one of them had fallen.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-55">Now while Judas and Jonathan were in Gilead and their brother Simon was in Galilee before Ptolemais,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-56">Joseph son of Zechariah, and Azariah, the commanders of the forces, heard of their brave deeds and of the heroic war they had fought.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-57">So they said, “Let us also make a name for ourselves; let us go and make war on the Gentiles around us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-58">So they issued orders to the men of the forces that were with them and marched against Jamnia.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-59">Gorgias and his men came out of the town to meet them in battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-60">Then Joseph and Azariah were routed, and were pursued to the borders of Judea; as many as two thousand of the people of Israel fell that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-61">Thus the people suffered a great rout because, thinking to do a brave deed, they did not listen to Judas and his brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-62">But they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-63">The man Judas and his brothers were greatly honored in all Israel and among all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-64">People gathered to them and praised them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-65">Then Judas and his brothers went out and fought the descendants of Esau in the land to the south. He struck Hebron and its villages and tore down its strongholds and burned its towers on all sides.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-66">Then he marched off to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Marisa.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-67">On that day some priests, who wished to do a brave deed, fell in battle, for they went out to battle unwisely.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Macc-5-68">But Judas turned aside to Azotus in the land of the Philistines; he tore down their altars, and the carved images of their gods he burned with fire; he plundered the towns and returned to the land of Judah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Maccabees+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Maccabees+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
