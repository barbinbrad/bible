A reed shaken by the wind?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-8">What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-9">What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-10">This is the one about whom it is written, ‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-11">Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-12">From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-13">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John came;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-14">and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-15">Let anyone with ears listen!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-16">“But to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-17">‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-19">the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-20">Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done, because they did not repent.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-21">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-22">But I tell you, on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-23">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. &nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-24">But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-25">At that time Jesus said, “I thank  you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-26">yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-27">All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-28">“Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-29">Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-11-30">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
