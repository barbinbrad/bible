See to it yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-5">Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-6">But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-7">After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter’s field as a place to bury foreigners.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-8">For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-9">Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-10">and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-11">Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-12">But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-13">Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many accusations they make against you?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-14">But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-15">Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd, anyone whom they wanted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-16">At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-17">So after they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-18">For he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-19">While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-21">The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-22">Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” All of them said, “Let him be crucified!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-23">Then he asked, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-24">So when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-25">Then the people as a whole answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-26">So he released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters, and they gathered the whole cohort around him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-28">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-29">and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-30">They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-31">After mocking him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-32">As they went out, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon; they compelled this man to carry his cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-33">And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-34">they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-35">And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-36">then they sat down there and kept watch over him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-37">Over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-38">Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-39">Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-40">and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-41">In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-42">“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-43">He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-44">The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-45">From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-46">And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-47">When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-48">At once one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-49">But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-50">Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-51">At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-52">The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-53">After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-54">Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-55">Many women were also there, looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and had provided for him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-57">When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-59">So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-62">The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-63">and said, “Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-64">Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception would be worse than the first.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-65">Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-66">So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
