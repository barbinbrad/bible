But they said, What is that to us? see thou .&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-5">And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-6">And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-8">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom  of the children of Israel did price;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-10">and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-11">Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-13">Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-14">And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-15">Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-19">And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-21">But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-22">Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-23">And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-24">So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye .&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-25">And all the people answered and said, His blood  on us, and on our children.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-26">Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-29">And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-30">And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-31">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go , that he might bear his cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-33">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-34">they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-35">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-36">and they sat and watched him there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-37">And they set up over his head his accusation written, This is Jesus the King of the Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-38">Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-39">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-40">and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-41">In like manner also the chief priests mocking , with the scribes and elders, said,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-43">He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-44">And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-47">And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-49">And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-50">And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-51">And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-52">and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-53">and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-54">Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-55">And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-57">And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-58">this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-59">And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-61">And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-62">Now on the morrow, which is  after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-63">saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it  sure as ye can.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-27-66">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
