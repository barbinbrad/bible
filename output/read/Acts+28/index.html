who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-8">And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-9">And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-10">who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-11">And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-12">And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-13">And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-15">And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-16">And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-17">And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-20">For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with : for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-23">And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded , testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-26">saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-27">For this peopleâ€™s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-28">Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-29">And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-28-30">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+27/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+1/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
