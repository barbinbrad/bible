For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. Will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-6">But the godless are all like thorns that are thrown away; for they cannot be picked up with the hand;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-7">to touch them one uses an iron bar or the shaft of a spear. And they are entirely consumed in fire on the spot.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-8">These are the names of the warriors whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the Three; he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-9">Next to him among the three warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-10">but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day. Then the people came back to him—but only to strip the dead.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-11">Next to him was Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-12">But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-13">Towards the beginning of harvest three of the thirty chiefs went down to join David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-14">David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-15">David said longingly, “O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-16">Then the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the Lord,&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-17">for he said, “The Lord forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three warriors did these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-18">Now Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Thirty. With his spear he fought against three hundred men and killed them, and won a name beside the Three.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-19">He was the most renowned of the Thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the Three.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-20">Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant warrior from Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-21">And he killed an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but Benaiah went against him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-22">Such were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and won a name beside the three warriors.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-23">He was renowned among the Thirty, but he did not attain to the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-24">Among the Thirty were Asahel brother of Joab; Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-25">Shammah of Harod; Elika of Harod;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-26">Helez the Paltite; Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-27">Abiezer of Anathoth; Mebunnai the Hushathite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-28">Zalmon the Ahohite; Maharai of Netophah;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-29">Heleb son of Baanah of Netophah; Ittai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-30">Benaiah of Pirathon; Hiddai of the torrents of Gaash;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-31">Abi-albon the Arbathite; Azmaveth of Bahurim;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-32">Eliahba of Shaalbon; the sons of Jashen: Jonathan&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-33">son of Shammah the Hararite; Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-34">Eliphelet son of Ahasbai of Maacah; Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-35">Hezro of Carmel; Paarai the Arbite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-36">Igal son of Nathan of Zobah; Bani the Gadite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-37">Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-38">Ira the Ithrite; Gareb the Ithrite;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-23-39">Uriah the Hittite—thirty-seven in all.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+22/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
