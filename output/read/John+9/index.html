He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-8">The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-9">Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am .&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-10">They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-11">He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-12">And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-13">They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-14">Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-17">They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-19">and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-20">His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-21">but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-22">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him  Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-24">So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-25">He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-26">They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-27">He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-28">And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-29">We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-30">The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and  he opened mine eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-31">We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-32">Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-37">Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-39">And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
