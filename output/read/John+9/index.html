Then he went and washed and came back able to see.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-8">The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-9">Some were saying, “It is he.” Others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-10">But they kept asking him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-11">He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ Then I went and washed and received my sight.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-12">They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-13">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-14">Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-15">Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-16">Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And they were divided.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-17">So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” He said, “He is a prophet.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-18">The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-19">and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-20">His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-21">but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-22">His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-23">Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-24">So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-25">He answered, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-26">They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-27">He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-28">Then they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-29">We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-30">The man answered, “Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-31">We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-32">Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-34">They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?” And they drove him out.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-35">Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-36">He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-37">Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-38">He said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped him.&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-39">Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-40">Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, “Surely we are not blind, are we?”&nbsp;</span><span id="John-9-41">Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../John+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../John+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
