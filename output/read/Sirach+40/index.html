And when one rests upon his bed, his sleep at night confuses his mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-6">He gets little or no rest; he struggles in his sleep as he did by day. He is troubled by the visions of his mind like one who has escaped from the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-7">At the moment he reaches safety he wakes up, astonished that his fears were groundless.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-8">To all creatures, human and animal, but to sinners seven times more,&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-9">come death and bloodshed and strife and sword, calamities and famine and ruin and plague.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-10">All these were created for the wicked, and on their account the flood came.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-11">All that is of earth returns to earth, and what is from above returns above.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-12">All bribery and injustice will be blotted out, but good faith will last forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-13">The wealth of the unjust will dry up like a river, and crash like a loud clap of thunder in a storm.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-14">As a generous person has cause to rejoice, so lawbreakers will utterly fail.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-15">The children of the ungodly put out few branches; they are unhealthy roots on sheer rock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-16">The reeds by any water or river bank are plucked up before any grass;&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-17">but kindness is like a garden of blessings, and almsgiving endures forever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-18">Wealth and wages make life sweet, but better than either is finding a treasure.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-19">Children and the building of a city establish one’s name, but better than either is the one who finds wisdom. Cattle and orchards make one prosperous; but a blameless wife is accounted better than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-20">Wine and music gladden the heart, but the love of friends is better than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-21">The flute and the harp make sweet melody, but a pleasant voice is better than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-22">The eye desires grace and beauty, but the green shoots of grain more than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-23">A friend or companion is always welcome, but a sensible wife is better than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-24">Kindred and helpers are for a time of trouble, but almsgiving rescues better than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-25">Gold and silver make one stand firm, but good counsel is esteemed more than either.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-26">Riches and strength build up confidence, but the fear of the Lord is better than either. There is no want in the fear of the Lord, and with it there is no need to seek for help.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-27">The fear of the Lord is like a garden of blessing, and covers a person better than any glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-28">My child, do not lead the life of a beggar; it is better to die than to beg.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-29">When one looks to the table of another, one’s way of life cannot be considered a life. One loses self-respect with another person’s food, but one who is intelligent and well instructed guards against that.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-40-30">In the mouth of the shameless begging is sweet, but it kindles a fire inside him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+39/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+41/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
