but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-4">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-5">Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-6">that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-7">Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-8">For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises  unto the fathers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-9">and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-10">And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-11">And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-12">And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-13">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-14">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-15">But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-16">that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-17">I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-18">For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-19">in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-20">yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was  named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-21">but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-22">Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-23">but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-24">whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-25">but now, , I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-26">For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-27">Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it  also to minister unto them in carnal things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-28">When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-29">And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-30">Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-31">that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and  my ministration which  for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-32">that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.&nbsp;</span><span id="Rom-15-33">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Romans+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Romans+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
