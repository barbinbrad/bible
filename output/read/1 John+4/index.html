And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-4">Little children, you are from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-5">They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-6">We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-7">Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-8">Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-9">God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-10">In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-11">Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-12">No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-13">By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-14">And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-15">God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-16">So we have known and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. &nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-17">Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-18">There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-19">We love because he first loved us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-20">Those who say, “I love God,” and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-4-21">The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 John+3/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 John+5/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
