So they buried him with his ancestors in the field between Dothan and Balamon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-4">Judith remained as a widow for three years and four months&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-5">at home where she set up a tent for herself on the roof of her house. She put sackcloth around her waist and dressed in widow’s clothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-6">She fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the day before the sabbath and the sabbath itself, the day before the new moon and the day of the new moon, and the festivals and days of rejoicing of the house of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-7">She was beautiful in appearance, and was very lovely to behold. Her husband Manasseh had left her gold and silver, men and women slaves, livestock, and fields; and she maintained this estate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-8">No one spoke ill of her, for she feared God with great devotion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-9">When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days,&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-10">she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-11">They came to her, and she said to them: “Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. &nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-12">Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs?&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-13">You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything!&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-14">You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-15">For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-16">Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-17">Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-18">“For never in our generation, nor in these present days, has there been any tribe or family or people or town of ours that worships gods made with hands, as was done in days gone by.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-19">That was why our ancestors were handed over to the sword and to pillage, and so they suffered a great catastrophe before our enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-20">But we know no other god but him, and so we hope that he will not disdain us or any of our nation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-21">For if we are captured, all Judea will be captured and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will make us pay for its desecration with our blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-22">The slaughter of our kindred and the captivity of the land and the desolation of our inheritance—all this he will bring on our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we serve as slaves; and we shall be an offense and a disgrace in the eyes of those who acquire us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-23">For our slavery will not bring us into favor, but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-24">“Therefore, my brothers, let us set an example for our kindred, for their lives depend upon us, and the sanctuary—both the temple and the altar—rests upon us.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-25">In spite of everything let us give thanks to the Lord our God, who is putting us to the test as he did our ancestors.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-26">Remember what he did with Abraham, and how he tested Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Syrian Mesopotamia, while he was tending the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-27">For he has not tried us with fire, as he did them, to search their hearts, nor has he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord scourges those who are close to him in order to admonish them.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-28">Then Uzziah said to her, “All that you have said was spoken out of a true heart, and there is no one who can deny your words.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-29">Today is not the first time your wisdom has been shown, but from the beginning of your life all the people have recognized your understanding, for your heart’s disposition is right.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-30">But the people were so thirsty that they compelled us to do for them what we have promised, and made us take an oath that we cannot break.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-31">Now since you are a God-fearing woman, pray for us, so that the Lord may send us rain to fill our cisterns. Then we will no longer feel faint from thirst.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-32">Then Judith said to them, “Listen to me. I am about to do something that will go down through all generations of our descendants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-33">Stand at the town gate tonight so that I may go out with my maid; and within the days after which you have promised to surrender the town to our enemies, the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-34">Only, do not try to find out what I am doing; for I will not tell you until I have finished what I am about to do.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-35">Uzziah and the rulers said to her, “Go in peace, and may the Lord God go before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Jdt-8-36">So they returned from the tent and went to their posts.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Judith+7/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Judith+9/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
