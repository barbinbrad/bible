But only speak the word, and let my servant be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-8">For I also am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and the slave does it.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-9">When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-10">When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-11">Soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-12">As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow; and with her was a large crowd from the town.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-13">When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-14">Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, rise!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-15">The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-16">Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has risen among us!” and “God has looked favorably on his people!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-17">This word about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-18">The disciples of John reported all these things to him. So John summoned two of his disciples&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-19">and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-20">When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-21">Jesus had just then cured many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits, and had given sight to many who were blind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-22">And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good news brought to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-23">And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-24">When John’s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-25">What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-26">What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-27">This is the one about whom it is written, ‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-28">I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-29">(And all the people who heard this, including the tax collectors, acknowledged the justice of God, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-30">But by refusing to be baptized by him, the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s purpose for themselves.)&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-31">“To what then will I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-32">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not weep.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-33">For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon’;&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-34">the Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-35">Nevertheless, wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-36">One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-37">And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-38">She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-39">Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him—that she is a sinner.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-40">Jesus spoke up and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” “Teacher,” he replied, “speak.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-41">“A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-42">When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-43">Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.” And Jesus said to him, “You have judged rightly.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-44">Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-45">You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-46">You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-47">Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-48">Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-49">But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Luke-7-50">And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Luke+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Luke+8/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
