These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-6">Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-7">your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-8">Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-9">And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-10">And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-11">But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-12">I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-13">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-14">behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-15">And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-16">so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-17">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-18">But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-19">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-20">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-21">And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-22">They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-23">They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-24">And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Isa-65-25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food.
