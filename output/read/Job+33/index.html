I will answer you: God is greater than any mortal.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-13">Why do you contend against him, saying, ‘He will answer none of my words’?&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-14">For God speaks in one way, and in two, though people do not perceive it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on mortals, while they slumber on their beds,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-16">then he opens their ears, and terrifies them with warnings,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-17">that he may turn them aside from their deeds, and keep them from pride,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-18">to spare their souls from the Pit, their lives from traversing the River.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-19">They are also chastened with pain upon their beds, and with continual strife in their bones,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-20">so that their lives loathe bread, and their appetites dainty food.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-21">Their flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen; and their bones, once invisible, now stick out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-22">Their souls draw near the Pit, and their lives to those who bring death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-23">Then, if there should be for one of them an angel, a mediator, one of a thousand, one who declares a person upright,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-24">and he is gracious to that person, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down into the Pit; I have found a ransom;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-25">let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor’;&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-26">then he prays to God, and is accepted by him, he comes into his presence with joy, and God repays him for his righteousness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-27">That person sings to others and says, ‘I sinned, and perverted what was right, and it was not paid back to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-28">He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-29">“God indeed does all these things, twice, three times, with mortals,&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-30">to bring back their souls from the Pit, so that they may see the light of life.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-31">Pay heed, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-32">If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Job-33-33">If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Job+32/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Job+34/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
