These were born to David in Hebron.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-6">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-7">Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and  said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-8">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-9">God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-11">And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-12">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying , Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-13">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-14">And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-15">And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-16">And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-17">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-18">now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-19">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-21">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-22">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-23">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-24">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-25">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-26">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-27">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-28">And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-29">let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-30">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-31">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-32">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-33">And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-34">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him. &nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-35">And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-36">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-38">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-3-39">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
