Then he went home; &nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-20">and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-21">When his family heard it, they went out to restrain him, for people were saying, “He has gone out of his mind.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-22">And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-23">And he called them to him, and spoke to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-25">And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-26">And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-27">But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man; then indeed the house can be plundered.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-28">“Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-29">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-30">for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-31">Then his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside, they sent to him and called him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-32">A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, asking for you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-33">And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-34">And looking at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-35">Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
