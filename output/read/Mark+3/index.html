But they held their peace.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-5">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-6">And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-7">And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-9">And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-10">for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-11">And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-12">And he charged them much that they should not make him known.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-13">And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-14">And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-15">and to have authority to cast out demons:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-16">and Simon he surnamed Peter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-17">and James the  of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the  of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-19">and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house. &nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-20">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-21">And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-22">And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-23">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-24">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-25">And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-26">And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-27">But no one can enter into the house of the strong , and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong ; and then he will spoil his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-28">Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-29">but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-30">because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-31">And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-32">And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-33">And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-34">And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-3-35">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
