There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-6">As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-7">I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-8">But I replied, ‘By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-9">But a second time the voice answered from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call profane.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-10">This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-11">At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-12">The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-13">He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-14">he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-17">If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-18">When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-19">Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-20">But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-22">News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-23">When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-24">for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-25">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-26">and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-27">At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-28">One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius.&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-29">The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea;&nbsp;</span><span id="Acts-11-30">this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Acts+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Acts+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
