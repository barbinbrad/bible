Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-3">When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-4">Jesus answered them, “Beware that no one leads you astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-5">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah!’ and they will lead many astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-6">And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-7">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-8">all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-9">“Then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-10">Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-11">And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-12">And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-13">But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-14">And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-15">“So when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place, as was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand),&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-16">then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-17">the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-18">the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-19">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-20">Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-21">For at that time there will be great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-22">And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-23">Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’—do not believe it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-24">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-25">Take note, I have told you beforehand.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-26">So, if they say to you, ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look! He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-27">For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-28">Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-29">“Immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-30">Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see ‘the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great glory.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-31">And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-32">“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-33">So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-34">Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-35">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-36">“But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-37">For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-38">For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-39">and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-40">Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-41">Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-42">Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-43">But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-44">Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-45">“Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom his master has put in charge of his household, to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-46">Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-47">Truly I tell you, he will put that one in charge of all his possessions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-48">But if that wicked slave says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-49">and he begins to beat his fellow slaves, and eats and drinks with drunkards,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-50">the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-24-51">He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+23/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+25/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
