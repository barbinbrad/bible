Now the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-4">In the pass, by which Jonathan tried to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and a rocky crag on the other; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-5">One crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-6">Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the Lord will act for us; for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many or by few.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-7">His armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that your mind inclines to. I am with you; as your mind is, so is mine.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-8">Then Jonathan said, “Now we will cross over to those men and will show ourselves to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-9">If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-10">But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for the Lord has given them into our hand. That will be the sign for us.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-11">So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-12">The men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, saying, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.” Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me; for the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-13">Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer following after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer, coming after him, killed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-14">In that first slaughter Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men within an area about half a furrow long in an acre of land.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-15">There was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-16">Saul’s lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin were watching as the multitude was surging back and forth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-17">Then Saul said to the troops that were with him, “Call the roll and see who has gone from us.” When they had called the roll, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-18">Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For at that time the ark of God went with the Israelites.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-19">While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-20">Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and every sword was against the other, so that there was very great confusion.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-21">Now the Hebrews who previously had been with the Philistines and had gone up with them into the camp turned and joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-22">Likewise, when all the Israelites who had gone into hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed closely after them in the battle.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-23">So the Lord gave Israel the victory that day. The battle passed beyond Beth-aven, and the troops with Saul numbered altogether about ten thousand men. The battle spread out over the hill country of Ephraim.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-24">Now Saul committed a very rash act on that day. He had laid an oath on the troops, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before it is evening and I have been avenged on my enemies.” So none of the troops tasted food.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-25">All the troops came upon a honeycomb; and there was honey on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-26">When the troops came upon the honeycomb, the honey was dripping out; but they did not put their hands to their mouths, for they feared the oath.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-27">But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the troops with the oath; so he extended the staff that was in his hand, and dipped the tip of it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-28">Then one of the soldiers said, “Your father strictly charged the troops with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food this day.’ And so the troops are faint.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-29">Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-30">How much better if today the troops had eaten freely of the spoil taken from their enemies; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-31">After they had struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, the troops were very faint;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-32">so the troops flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the troops ate them with the blood.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-33">Then it was reported to Saul, “Look, the troops are sinning against the Lord by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone before me here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-34">Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the troops, and say to them, ‘Let all bring their oxen or their sheep, and slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood.’” So all of the troops brought their oxen with them that night, and slaughtered them there.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-35">And Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar that he built to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-36">Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave one of them.” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-37">So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-38">Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people; and let us find out how this sin has arisen today.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-39">For as the Lord lives who saves Israel, even if it is in my son Jonathan, he shall surely die!” But there was no one among all the people who answered him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-40">He said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-41">Then Saul said, “O Lord God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant today? If this guilt is in me or in my son Jonathan, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were indicated by the lot, but the people were cleared.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-42">Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-44">Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-45">Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the Lord lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, and he did not die.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-46">Then Saul withdrew from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-47">When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he routed them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-48">He did valiantly, and struck down the Amalekites, and rescued Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger, Michal.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-50">The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-51">Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Sam-14-52">There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong or valiant warrior, he took him into his service.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Samuel+13/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Samuel+15/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
