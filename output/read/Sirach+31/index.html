For he has done wonders among his people.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-10">Who has been tested by it and been found perfect? Let it be for him a ground for boasting. Who has had the power to transgress and did not transgress, and to do evil and did not do it?&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-11">His prosperity will be established, and the assembly will proclaim his acts of charity.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-12">Are you seated at the table of the great? Do not be greedy at it, and do not say, “How much food there is here!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-13">Remember that a greedy eye is a bad thing. What has been created more greedy than the eye? Therefore it sheds tears for any reason.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-14">Do not reach out your hand for everything you see, and do not crowd your neighbor at the dish.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-15">Judge your neighbor’s feelings by your own, and in every matter be thoughtful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-16">Eat what is set before you like a well brought-up person, and do not chew greedily, or you will give offense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-17">Be the first to stop, as befits good manners, and do not be insatiable, or you will give offense.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-18">If you are seated among many persons, do not help yourself before they do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-19">How ample a little is for a well-disciplined person! He does not breathe heavily when in bed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-20">Healthy sleep depends on moderate eating; he rises early, and feels fit. The distress of sleeplessness and of nausea and colic are with the glutton.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-21">If you are overstuffed with food, get up to vomit, and you will have relief.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-22">Listen to me, my child, and do not disregard me, and in the end you will appreciate my words. In everything you do be moderate, and no sickness will overtake you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-23">People bless the one who is liberal with food, and their testimony to his generosity is trustworthy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-24">The city complains of the one who is stingy with food, and their testimony to his stinginess is accurate.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-25">Do not try to prove your strength by wine-drinking, for wine has destroyed many.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-26">As the furnace tests the work of the smith, so wine tests hearts when the insolent quarrel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-27">Wine is very life to human beings if taken in moderation. What is life to one who is without wine? It has been created to make people happy.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-28">Wine drunk at the proper time and in moderation is rejoicing of heart and gladness of soul.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-29">Wine drunk to excess leads to bitterness of spirit, to quarrels and stumbling.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-30">Drunkenness increases the anger of a fool to his own hurt, reducing his strength and adding wounds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-31-31">Do not reprove your neighbor at a banquet of wine, and do not despise him in his merrymaking; speak no word of reproach to him, and do not distress him by making demands of him.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+30/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+32/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
