A sower went out to sow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-4">And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-5">Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-6">But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-7">Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-8">Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-9">Let anyone with ears listen!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-10">Then the disciples came and asked him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-11">He answered, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-12">For to those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-13">The reason I speak to them in parables is that ‘seeing they do not perceive, and hearing they do not listen, nor do they understand.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-14">With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: ‘You will indeed listen, but never understand, and you will indeed look, but never perceive.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-15">For this people’s heart has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn— and I would heal them.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-17">Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-18">“Hear then the parable of the sower.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-19">When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-20">As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-21">yet such a person has no root, but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-22">As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-23">But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-24">He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-25">but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-26">So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-27">And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-28">He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-29">But he replied, ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-30">Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-31">He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-32">it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-33">He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-34">Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables; without a parable he told them nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-35">This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth to speak in parables; I will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-36">Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-37">He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-38">the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-39">and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-40">Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-41">The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-42">and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-43">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-44">“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-45">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-46">on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-47">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-48">when it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-49">So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-50">and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-51">“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-52">And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-53">When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-54">He came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-55">Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-56">And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-57">And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-58">And he did not do many deeds of power there, because of their unbelief.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
