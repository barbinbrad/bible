This is he that was sown by the way side.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-20">And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-21">yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-22">And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-23">And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-26">But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-27">And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-28">And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-29">But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-32">which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-34">All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-35">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-36">Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-37">And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil ;&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-39">and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-40">As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-42">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-44">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-46">and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-48">which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-49">So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-51">Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-52">And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-53">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-54">And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-55">Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.&nbsp;</span><span id="Matt-13-58">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Matthew+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Matthew+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
