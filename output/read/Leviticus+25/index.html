It shall be a jubilee for you: you shall return, every one of you, to your property and every one of you to your family.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-11">That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall not sow, or reap the aftergrowth, or harvest the unpruned vines.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-12">For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat only what the field itself produces.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-13">In this year of jubilee you shall return, every one of you, to your property.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-14">When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not cheat one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-15">When you buy from your neighbor, you shall pay only for the number of years since the jubilee; the seller shall charge you only for the remaining crop years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-16">If the years are more, you shall increase the price, and if the years are fewer, you shall diminish the price; for it is a certain number of harvests that are being sold to you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-17">You shall not cheat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-18">You shall observe my statutes and faithfully keep my ordinances, so that you may live on the land securely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-19">The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live on it securely.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-20">Should you ask, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-21">I will order my blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will yield a crop for three years.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-22">When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating from the old crop; until the ninth year, when its produce comes in, you shall eat the old.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-23">The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-24">Throughout the land that you hold, you shall provide for the redemption of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-25">If anyone of your kin falls into difficulty and sells a piece of property, then the next of kin shall come and redeem what the relative has sold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-26">If the person has no one to redeem it, but then prospers and finds sufficient means to do so,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-27">the years since its sale shall be computed and the difference shall be refunded to the person to whom it was sold, and the property shall be returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-28">But if there are not sufficient means to recover it, what was sold shall remain with the purchaser until the year of jubilee; in the jubilee it shall be released, and the property shall be returned.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-29">If anyone sells a dwelling house in a walled city, it may be redeemed until a year has elapsed since its sale; the right of redemption shall be one year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-30">If it is not redeemed before a full year has elapsed, a house that is in a walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the purchaser, throughout the generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-31">But houses in villages that have no walls around them shall be classed as open country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-32">As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites shall forever have the right of redemption of the houses in the cities belonging to them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-33">Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites—houses sold in a city belonging to them—shall be released in the jubilee; because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-34">But the open land around their cities may not be sold; for that is their possession for all time.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-35">If any of your kin fall into difficulty and become dependent on you, you shall support them; they shall live with you as though resident aliens.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-36">Do not take interest in advance or otherwise make a profit from them, but fear your God; let them live with you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-37">You shall not lend them your money at interest taken in advance, or provide them food at a profit.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-38">I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-39">If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-40">They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-41">Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority; they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-42">For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-43">You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-44">As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-45">You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-46">You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-47">If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch of the alien’s family,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-48">after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption; one of their brothers may redeem them,&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-49">or their uncle or their uncle’s son may redeem them, or anyone of their family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may redeem themselves.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-50">They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be rated as the time of a hired laborer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-51">If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion to the purchase price;&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-52">and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus: according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-53">As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien’s authority, who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-54">And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children with them shall go free in the jubilee year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Lev-25-55">For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Leviticus+24/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Leviticus+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
