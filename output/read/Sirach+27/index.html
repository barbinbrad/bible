so do a person’s faults when he speaks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-5">The kiln tests the potter’s vessels; so the test of a person is in his conversation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-6">Its fruit discloses the cultivation of a tree; so a person’s speech discloses the cultivation of his mind.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-7">Do not praise anyone before he speaks, for this is the way people are tested.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-8">If you pursue justice, you will attain it and wear it like a glorious robe.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-9">Birds roost with their own kind, so honesty comes home to those who practice it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-10">A lion lies in wait for prey; so does sin for evildoers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-11">The conversation of the godly is always wise, but the fool changes like the moon.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-12">Among stupid people limit your time, but among thoughtful people linger on.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-13">The talk of fools is offensive, and their laughter is wantonly sinful.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-14">Their cursing and swearing make one’s hair stand on end, and their quarrels make others stop their ears.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-15">The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed, and their abuse is grievous to hear.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-16">Whoever betrays secrets destroys confidence, and will never find a congenial friend.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-17">Love your friend and keep faith with him; but if you betray his secrets, do not follow after him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-18">For as a person destroys his enemy, so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-19">And as you allow a bird to escape from your hand, so you have let your neighbor go, and will not catch him again.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-20">Do not go after him, for he is too far off, and has escaped like a gazelle from a snare.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-21">For a wound may be bandaged, and there is reconciliation after abuse, but whoever has betrayed secrets is without hope.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-22">Whoever winks the eye plots mischief, and those who know him will keep their distance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-23">In your presence his mouth is all sweetness, and he admires your words; but later he will twist his speech and with your own words he will trip you up.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-24">I have hated many things, but him above all; even the Lord hates him.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-25">Whoever throws a stone straight up throws it on his own head, and a treacherous blow opens up many wounds.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-26">Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and whoever sets a snare will be caught in it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-27">If a person does evil, it will roll back upon him, and he will not know where it came from.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-28">Mockery and abuse issue from the proud, but vengeance lies in wait for them like a lion.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-29">Those who rejoice in the fall of the godly will be caught in a snare, and pain will consume them before their death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Sir-27-30">Anger and wrath, these also are abominations, yet a sinner holds on to them.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Sirach+26/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Sirach+28/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
