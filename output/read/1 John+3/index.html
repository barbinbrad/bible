For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-2">Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-3">And every one that hath this hope  on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-4">Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-5">And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-6">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-7">little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-8">he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-9">Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-11">For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-12">not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-13">Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-14">We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-16">Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-17">But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-18">little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-19">Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-20">because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-22">and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-23">And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-24">And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
