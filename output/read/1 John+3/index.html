The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-2">Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-3">And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-4">Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-5">You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-6">No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-7">Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-8">Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-9">Those who have been born of God do not sin, because God’s seed abides in them; they cannot sin, because they have been born of God.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-10">The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way: all who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-11">For this is the message you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-12">We must not be like Cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-13">Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-14">We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love abides in death.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-15">All who hate a brother or sister are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-16">We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us—and we ought to lay down our lives for one another.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-17">How does God’s love abide in anyone who has the world’s goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-18">Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-19">And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-20">whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-21">Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God;&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-22">and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-23">And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us.&nbsp;</span><span id="1John-3-24">All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 John+2/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 John+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
