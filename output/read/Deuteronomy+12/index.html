You shall go there,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-6">bringing there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, your votive gifts, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-7">And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your households together, rejoicing in all the undertakings in which the Lord your God has blessed you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-8">You shall not act as we are acting here today, all of us according to our own desires,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-9">for you have not yet come into the rest and the possession that the Lord your God is giving you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-10">When you cross over the Jordan and live in the land that the Lord your God is allotting to you, and when he gives you rest from your enemies all around so that you live in safety,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-11">then you shall bring everything that I command you to the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all your choice votive gifts that you vow to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-12">And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you together with your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levites who reside in your towns (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you).&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-13">Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place you happen to see.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-14">But only at the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes—there you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do everything I command you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-15">Yet whenever you desire you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as they would of gazelle or deer.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-16">The blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-17">Nor may you eat within your towns the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, the firstlings of your herds and your flocks, any of your votive gifts that you vow, your freewill offerings, or your donations;&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-18">these you shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God at the place that the Lord your God will choose, you together with your son and your daughter, your male and female slaves, and the Levites resident in your towns, rejoicing in the presence of the Lord your God in all your undertakings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-19">Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-20">When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, “I am going to eat some meat,” because you wish to eat meat, you may eat meat whenever you have the desire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-21">If the place where the Lord your God will choose to put his name is too far from you, and you slaughter as I have commanded you any of your herd or flock that the Lord has given you, then you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-22">Indeed, just as gazelle or deer is eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-23">Only be sure that you do not eat the blood; for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the meat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-24">Do not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-25">Do not eat it, so that all may go well with you and your children after you, because you do what is right in the sight of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-26">But the sacred donations that are due from you, and your votive gifts, you shall bring to the place that the Lord will choose.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-27">You shall present your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God; the blood of your other sacrifices shall be poured out beside the altar of the Lord your God, but the meat you may eat.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-28">Be careful to obey all these words that I command you today, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-29">When the Lord your God has cut off before you the nations whom you are about to enter to dispossess them, when you have dispossessed them and live in their land,&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-30">take care that you are not snared into imitating them, after they have been destroyed before you: do not inquire concerning their gods, saying, “How did these nations worship their gods? I also want to do the same.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Deut-12-31">You must not do the same for the Lord your God, because every abhorrent thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods.
