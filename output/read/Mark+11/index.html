And his disciples heard it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-15">And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-16">and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-17">And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-18">And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-19">And every evening he went forth out of the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-20">And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-21">And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-22">And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-23">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-24">Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-25">And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-26">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-27">and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-28">And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-29">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-30">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-31">But should we say, From menâ€”they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-32">And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
