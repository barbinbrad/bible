As they were untying it,&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-5">some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-6">They told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-7">Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-9">Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-10">Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-11">Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple; and when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-12">On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-14">He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-15">Then they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves;&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-16">and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-17">He was teaching and saying, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-18">And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-19">And when evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-20">In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-21">Then Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-22">Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-23">Truly I tell you, if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and if you do not doubt in your heart, but believe that what you say will come to pass, it will be done for you.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-24">So I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-25">“Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-26">Again they came to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-27">and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do them?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-28">Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-29">Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin? Answer me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-30">They argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-31">But shall we say, ‘Of human origin’?”—they were afraid of the crowd, for all regarded John as truly a prophet.&nbsp;</span><span id="Mark-11-32">So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Mark+10/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Mark+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
