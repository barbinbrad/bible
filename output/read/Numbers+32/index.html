When they saw that the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was a good place for cattle,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-2">the Gadites and the Reubenites came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-3">“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-4">the land that the Lord subdued before the congregation of Israel—is a land for cattle; and your servants have cattle.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-5">They continued, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not make us cross the Jordan.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-6">But Moses said to the Gadites and to the Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-7">Why will you discourage the hearts of the Israelites from going over into the land that the Lord has given them?&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-8">Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-9">When they went up to the Wadi Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the hearts of the Israelites from going into the land that the Lord had given them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-10">The Lord’s anger was kindled on that day and he swore, saying,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-11">‘Surely none of the people who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not unreservedly followed me—&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-12">none except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have unreservedly followed the Lord.’&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-13">And the Lord’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-14">And now you, a brood of sinners, have risen in place of your fathers, to increase the Lord’s fierce anger against Israel!&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-15">If you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-16">Then they came up to him and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks, and towns for our little ones,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-17">but we will take up arms as a vanguard before the Israelites, until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our little ones will stay in the fortified towns because of the inhabitants of the land.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-18">We will not return to our homes until all the Israelites have obtained their inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-19">We will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-20">So Moses said to them, “If you do this—if you take up arms to go before the Lord for the war,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-21">and all those of you who bear arms cross the Jordan before the Lord, until he has driven out his enemies from before him&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-22">and the land is subdued before the Lord—then after that you may return and be free of obligation to the Lord and to Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-23">But if you do not do this, you have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-24">Build towns for your little ones, and folds for your flocks; but do what you have promised.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-25">Then the Gadites and the Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-26">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall remain there in the towns of Gilead;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-27">but your servants will cross over, everyone armed for war, to do battle for the Lord, just as my lord orders.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-28">So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the ancestral houses of the Israelite tribes.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-29">And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and the Reubenites, everyone armed for battle before the Lord, will cross over the Jordan with you and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-30">but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-31">The Gadites and the Reubenites answered, “As the Lord has spoken to your servants, so we will do.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-32">We will cross over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.”&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-33">Moses gave to them—to the Gadites and to the Reubenites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph—the kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites and the kingdom of King Og of Bashan, the land and its towns, with the territories of the surrounding towns.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-34">And the Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-35">Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-36">Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-37">And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-38">Nebo, and Baal-meon (some names being changed), and Sibmah; and they gave names to the towns that they rebuilt.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-39">The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were there;&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-40">so Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-41">Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and renamed them Havvoth-jair.&nbsp;</span><span id="Num-32-42">And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and renamed it Nobah after himself.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Numbers+31/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Numbers+33/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
