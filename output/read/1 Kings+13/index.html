One of his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words also that he had spoken to the king, they told to their father.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-12">Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-13">Then he said to his sons, “Saddle a donkey for me.” So they saddled a donkey for him, and he mounted it.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-14">He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak tree. He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He answered, “I am.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-15">Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat some food.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-16">But he said, “I cannot return with you, or go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water with you in this place;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-17">for it was said to me by the word of the Lord: You shall not eat food or drink water there, or return by the way that you came.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-18">Then the other said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord: Bring him back with you into your house so that he may eat food and drink water.” But he was deceiving him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-19">Then the man of God went back with him, and ate food and drank water in his house.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-20">As they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back;&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-21">and he proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says the Lord: Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment that the Lord your God commanded you,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-22">but have come back and have eaten food and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, ‘Eat no food, and drink no water,’ your body shall not come to your ancestral tomb.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-23">After the man of God had eaten food and had drunk, they saddled for him a donkey belonging to the prophet who had brought him back.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-24">Then as he went away, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-25">People passed by and saw the body thrown in the road, with the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the town where the old prophet lived.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-26">When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him according to the word that the Lord spoke to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-27">Then he said to his sons, “Saddle a donkey for me.” So they saddled one,&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-28">and he went and found the body thrown in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-29">The prophet took up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to the city, to mourn and to bury him.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-30">He laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-31">After he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-32">For the saying that he proclaimed by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.”&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-33">Even after this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who wanted to be priests he consecrated for the high places.&nbsp;</span><span id="1Kgs-13-34">This matter became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../1 Kings+12/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../1 Kings+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
