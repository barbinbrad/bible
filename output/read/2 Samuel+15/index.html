Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-5">Whenever people came near to do obeisance to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of them, and kiss them.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-6">Thus Absalom did to every Israelite who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-7">At the end of four years Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron and pay the vow that I have made to the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-8">For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram: If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will worship the Lord in Hebron.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-9">The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up, and went to Hebron.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-10">But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then shout: Absalom has become king at Hebron!”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-11">Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom; they were invited guests, and they went in their innocence, knowing nothing of the matter.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-12">While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh. The conspiracy grew in strength, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-13">A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the Israelites have gone after Absalom.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-14">Then David said to all his officials who were with him at Jerusalem, “Get up! Let us flee, or there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry, or he will soon overtake us, and bring disaster down upon us, and attack the city with the edge of the sword.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-15">The king’s officials said to the king, “Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king decides.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-16">So the king left, followed by all his household, except ten concubines whom he left behind to look after the house.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-17">The king left, followed by all the people; and they stopped at the last house.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-18">All his officials passed by him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-19">Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also coming with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your home.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-20">You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your kinsfolk with you; and may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-21">But Ittai answered the king, “As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-22">David said to Ittai, “Go then, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-23">The whole country wept aloud as all the people passed by; the king crossed the Wadi Kidron, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-24">Abiathar came up, and Zadok also, with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-25">Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back and let me see both it and the place where it stays.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-26">But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-27">The king also said to the priest Zadok, “Look, go back to the city in peace, you and Abiathar, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-28">See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-29">So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-30">But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot; and all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-31">David was told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, “O Lord, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-32">When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-33">David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-34">But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,’ then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-35">The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar.&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-36">Their two sons are with them there, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan; and by them you shall report to me everything you hear.”&nbsp;</span><span id="2Sam-15-37">So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../2 Samuel+14/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../2 Samuel+16/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/defer.js" defer></script></body></html>
