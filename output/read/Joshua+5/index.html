To them the Lord swore that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-7">So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-8">When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-9">The Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt.” And so that place is called Gilgal to this day.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-10">While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal they kept the passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-11">On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-12">The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-13">Once when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you one of us, or one of our adversaries?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-14">He replied, “Neither; but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and he said to him, “What do you command your servant, my lord?”&nbsp;</span><span id="Josh-5-15">The commander of the army of the Lord said to Joshua, “Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Joshua+4/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Joshua+6/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="../../assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
