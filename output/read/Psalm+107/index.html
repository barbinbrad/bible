for he is good; For his lovingkindness  for ever.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-2">Let the redeemed of Jehovah say , Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-3">And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-4">They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-5">Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-6">Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-7">He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-8">Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-9">For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-10">Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-11">Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-12">Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-13">Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-14">He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-15">Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-16">For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-17">Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-18">Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-19">Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-20">He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth  from their destructions.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-21">Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-22">And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-23">They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-24">These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-25">For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-26">They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-27">They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their witsâ€™ end.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-28">Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-29">He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-30">Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-31">Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-32">Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-33">He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-34">A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-35">He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-36">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-37">And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-38">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-39">Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-40">He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-41">Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh  families like a flock.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-42">The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id="Ps-107-43">Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.&nbsp;</span></p><a class="prev" href="../Psalm+106/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Previous</title><path d="M10.75 0a.74.74 0 0 1 .53.22.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-9.47 9.47 9.47 9.47a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-10-10a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l10-10a.73.73 0 0 1 .53-.22z"></path></svg></a><a class="next" href="../Psalm+108/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11.5 21.5" width="11.5" height="21.5"><title>Next</title><path d="M.75 21.5a.74.74 0 0 1-.53-.22.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l9.47-9.47L.22 1.28A.75.75 0 0 1 1.28.22l10 10a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-10 10a.74.74 0 0 1-.53.22z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><script type="text/x-template" id="autocomplete"><div><input type="text" placeholder="Search" @keyup="fetchData()" @keydown="setFocus" @focus="inputFocus(true)" @blur="inputFocus(false)" v-model="inputtext" :class="{ isFocused  : isFocus }" class="form-control"/><list :results="autocompleteList"></list></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="results-list"><div class="results"><div class="autolist" v-if="results.length>0"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item" :class="checkSelected(index)" v-for="(result, index) in results" @mousemove="mouseHover(index)" @mousedown="selectResult(index)">{{result}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script type="text/x-template" id="chapter-slideout"><div class="chapter-drawer" :class="{ isOpen: isOpen }" @focusout="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-opener" v-if="!isOpen" @click="open"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"></path></svg></div><div class="chapter-drawer-background" @click="close"><div class="chapter-drawer-closer" @click="close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M6 18L18 6M6 6l12 12"></path></svg></div><ul class="chapter-drawer-menu"><li class="chapter-drawer-menu-item" v-for="book in bookChapters"><a :class="{ active  : book.active }" :href="book.link">{{book.name}} {{book.number}}</a></li></ul></div></div></script><script id="bookmark-dropdown" type="text/x-template"><div class="bookmark-dropdown" v-click-outside="close"><div @click="toggle" class="bookmark-dropdown-opener"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M16 4v12l-4-2-4 2V4M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path></svg></div><div v-if="isVisible" class="bookmark-dropdown-options"><ul><li :class="{ disabled : wasSet }" @click="set">{{setBookmarkText}}</li><li v-if="!disabled" @click="get">{{getBookmarkText}}</li></ul></div></div></script><script src="/assets/js/vue.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
